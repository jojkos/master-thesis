Cha.. Moo..hyuk
I'll make a lot of money. And go to Korea.
Wait, mother!
I'll go and place you in luxury.
Is it wrong if you think of love as a game too?
Later when that person betrays you, hurts you.. have a big heart, don't get heartbroken...
You're not well.
In your head.... there's still a bullet there.
Are you Korean?
You're Korean?
I'm saved!
Arrange a meeting with my mother.
Of course.
It's about time.
Who is it?
Let me use the bathroom.
But who is it?
-Bathroom.. Let me use the bathroom!
It's not public.
-I'm going to pee my pants.
Let me use the bathroom.
-Then go! I won't stop you.
What a wacko!
Hey!
Australia, right?
Right? Right? Australia, at Melbourne.
Don't you remember me? No.
It seems right?
Do you live here?
-Yes.
Maybe he's not the same person?
Is this your house?
-No, it's not mine. We just live in the basement for rent.
This house is a rich person's house, right?
Yes.
-So...
Is it a hella rich house?
But hey!
Why'd you piss at stranger's house?
Why would you do that?
Your piss!
I marked this place as my territory.
Dogs mark their territory like this.
What the. How can this place be your territory?
See you again.
I'll come to pee again tomorrow.
What is this. So is he saying that he's a dog? Wha?
That's right. I'm a dog.
Not a human being. A dog!
Your mom was a famous movie star a long time ago... And your brother is one of the top singer in our country. Killer, huh?
We found out about it....
You are twins...
What a weird person I meet as I live. Ugh, disgusting.
How filthy!
Are you Korean?
You're Korean?
Hey...
I have a husband..
Just go to sleep... If you don't want to die.
Jason sent you here.
Jason sent you here to kill me!
Did you think I'll get tricked? Do you really think I was going to get tricked by you old man!
How can that lady be my mom? how can that lady be my mom!
She is your mother!
-Don't lie!
If she lives so great, why would she abondon me?
With that money, she can buy all the milk in the world and raise 1000 children!
It's not like it was hard to live or even starve to death.
How, not one but two why would she abandon me!
Your mom is that kind of lady. Anything that gets in her way, children or else?
She's capable of that. Your mom does whatever she wishes.
Shut your mouth. I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to you old man!
Why, did your mom cause an accident again?
I don't want to be the mom?
i want to die. Why?
Is she in another accident?
Then, did he come to find me all the way from Australia?
But how'd he know where I live?
Is he a wacko?
Oh, Yoo!
Pork?
I'm going to put it in the jajang sauce.
It's not in your fridge?
Would you buy some? Yah, with side skins
Sure, thanks!
I'm an excellent cook.
Tangsooyook, Palboochae, Galbijim, shinsunyoo, pasta.
I also clean and do laundry extremely well.
There's nothing I can't do well
Later, I probably can raise babies well.
I won't let your hands touch water.
Well, we have to go there and see? but I'll be a good match for a husband.
Do you like me that much?
Of course
Ah! You're in big trouble Chae Yoon
Have you no idea what you want in a women?
Don't make me sad anymore.
Make me sad again, and I'll really die then.
I'll wait by your house.
I'll wait till you come out.
Sorry.
Pork...
Did he tell me to buy front leg?
Or back leg?
Or was it side skins?
Rock head rock head!
I should die!
You know how much I worked to get that shirt?
These girls need to be in jail and eat bean rice to wake them up.
Is seems like she didn't know. Why don't you forgive her.
I mean why make a big deal with just one shirt.
-Just one shirt?
With just this one shirt, I can feed 5 people in my family.
Nowadays we don't have much customers and we're about to starve to death.
Why did you steal it?
Didn't Galchi teach you that it's bad to steal clothes?
I gave money.
-You did?
Sure, if you pays...then I'll...
That doesn't make sense.
Are you fallen for her or something?
All the guys in my family and neighborhood have been drooling over her...
If you don't put her in jail, I'll going to bring my lawyer!
Why are you crying for?
Huh, why are you crying for.
(she gives narration)
With that brings the end of program...
Oh you're too kind!
When I look at it we can't praise you enough!
This is too much!
Excuse.
Let's talk for a minute
Couple days ago, there was a morning special adoption show right?
-Yes, there was.
Oh, they must be twins.
How cute.
Sorry I contact you again.
I'm sorry but can I hold your baby?
Can I feed him for some milk too?
...I'll give you milk.
Don't wanna? He doesn't want any. Your twins are too cute.
I want to raise twins too.
The mother must feel so happy
It hurts...
More gently!
Wake up!
The sun is up, you guys!
Aigoo, how disgusting.
If I could put you back into my stomache!
Sookchae wake up. Wake up!
Where's Eunchae?
Would she fit beneath the bed, mom?
She's with Yoon to help him out.
You little!
You'd hit your own mother?
- That's what I'm sayin!
Sorry!
I think that girl with thick lips recognizes you.
She probably thinks I just look similar.
Ah, eat.
In the whole world, eating eggs in the Hot Room is the best.
You should have gone somewhere else...why on a Sunday?
If we get caught, we'll die. -Just eat it.
You find it well.
-So this is how Hot Room looks like.
This is fun.
-Right?
Hey, not you too!
Don't you know the danger of another scandal broke loose? -I got it.
I'll be careful.
I don't have make up on, they won't recognize me.
Fruit ice cream is killer here.
-We should come here all the time.
What should we do?
I'll cause a distraction, so sneak away, ok?
Why are you crying, Miss?
Grandmother!
What am I going to do?
What's the matter?
Did someone hit you? -No...
My butt was burning...
Sauna's really hot, grandma
How embarassing.
Yoon
Where are you? -Olympic parkway.
Olympic parkway?
I'll drive Minjoo home and come back.
Hey, you're bleeding! Does it sting?
It stings, huh?
Oh, Minjoo fell and scratched her knee.
You should be careful.
It's ok.
I can take the bus.
You look normal, but how sad.
Here.
Thank you
- Let's go, mother.
What would her parents feel?
Did you eat?
You didn't eat, did you?
You don't look like you did.
Did you like me that much?
Even if you like me that much... All the way from Australia... Why would you come all this way?
Do you know someone who lives here?
You don't even know anyone and yet you still came for me?
It doesn't seem like we talked to each other that much.
But I'm not someone that anyone would like at first sight.
In anycase, thank you for liking a girl like me.
We don't have much food, but do you want to eat at my house?
Let's go. I can't give you my heart, but I can give you food.
Sorry...
Let's go...
This is Yoon's house and our house is over here.
Hey, but our house is this way...
Hey, not there!
This isn't our house...
We'll be in trouble if the lady comes out. Hurry, let's leave...
She probably has her reasons... Who can abandon their own flesh and blood?
Things can happen, right?
People live in poverty, But I hope she's living well!
Your eyes take after your mother's...
And you're all very smart!
I'll make a lot of money, and go back to Korea.
Meet my poor mother, buy her pretty clothes, some kalbi meat, and a gorgeous house.
Just wait, mom!
I'll go there and place you in riches.
Just wait five years!
Oh, how sad...
-Oh, Eunchae, you're here?
You were home?
Stella is so tragic.
-Stella?
Stella from 'Last Concert?
Have you never watched it?
Stella is a sad girl who comes out in the movie,
She has leukemia and, later, dies in front of her lover.
How can her life be like that?
Who mother dies... Her father has an affair and flees with his lover...
And then to abandone Richard who she loved. How hard it must be not to die... Take it easy, ma'am.
It's just a movie.
-It's just a movie, but my heart's aching!
I've watched it five times and everytime my heart hurts.
Son, my son!
It's not Yoon...
Who is that man?
Someone I sort of know...
He came into the wrong house.
What's with him?
Why is that man crying?
I did something wrong.
He must be hurt because of me.
But why did he look at me that way?
I'm sorry
Even though I appreciate it, I already have someone I like... There's no room for you...
Eat this!
Hey, Galchi, eat.
I told you I'm not speaking with you anymore!
I'm sorry...
Talk with me, hmm?
Going off stealing things Mom, I'm so embarrassed to death because of you.
It's so annoying!
I won't do it again. I won't.
You always say that!
Are you stupid?
Didn't you know your mom was stupid?
If she doesn't know, you can just keep telling her.
You can teach her!
Hold your spoon!
You know I'm a gangster, right? Do you want to get hit or do you want to eat?
Eat!
Drink water...
Drink it!
Even though your mom lives her life like that Even though she's an idiot, She doesn't throw away her children.
It's me... Danny...
How are you?
Is Korea good?
Yeah, thanks to you.
I checked into a really nice hotel with the money you gave me. You're right.
It's a lot of money...
Enough to last me a lifetime.
Thank you.
Why aren't you speaking in Korean? Is there something wrong?
I call because I wanted to ask you something.
How long did the doctor say I have to live?
I heard that I was dying but I didn't find out how much time I have left...
Do I have at least...
A year?
Not even...
A year?
Son, my son!
Won't you come and cheer me up?
-Who is that man?
It's your first time seeing me dance, huh?
How was it? The pd says it's corny.
You think it's corny too?
It's corny?
I'm not broadcasting ...I'm going home.
Hey, what's wrong?
Is it really corny?
Did I say that? -Yes.
-When?
- Right now!
It's not that really cool.
It kills!
You really said it was corny.
Is it really good?
When other people say something, you act as if nothing happened but when I say something..
Am I the only one to be pick on? Am I some kind of passing dog?
Not a dog, but a god.
You're my god.
Did you not know that?
If you like it, it's good no matter. If you don't like it, I break down.
I am to die for, right?
How did you get here?
-I have a shooting close by here. It's a short break and I heard Yoon's song.
I wanted to see him.
You should have called.
Where are you shooting?
-Close by here.
When are you singing?
-In a little while.
When I think of my mother, I'm grateful and I start to cry.
For giving birth to me, and raising me up so well.
Why are you here?
To see Yoon.
Let's go.
But there still time till the shooting.
Let go.
Why are you doing this?
Stand right there, Jo Yongho!
Let go of her hand.
-Go back and do your dance.
You can't let go?
Minjoo is my girl.
Let go of her hand.
You starting a fight?
-I told you to let go.
Fine. Let's end it today.
Say it now.
Me or Chae Yoon?
Me or Chae Yoon?
Can you both let go of my wrists?
On tomorrow's sports news page, it's going to be our headline.
My dad is going to explode again.
- Didn't you break up with him?
-I did.
I did but I don't think he can.
You, do you want to see me die today?
Are you two debating?
Always saying you're going to die. Its getting so old.
Do you guys die because of a woman?
Do you die because of a person?
How tedious.
I should stop playing with kids.
I'm sorry but I don't believe in love.
Especially guys like you who always talk about love? I don't believe in it more.
You said that if I died, you'd come along with me.
Chaeyoon didn't you say you loved me more than yourself?
Is that true?
Would that really be true?
Would a love like that.. Exist really?
Yoon can't swim!
He can't swim!
What about Minjoo?
Don't worry.
She's fine.
Stay still!
Would you like to wait a bit? I'll bring Yoon's clothes, wanna wear that?
Wait!
You'll catch cold like that.
You don't listen!
Mister! Wake up!
What'd you do all that time Not knowing how to swim .
It seem like you like that girl. You must been embarrassed a bit.
Are you the person who saved us?
-Maybe...
Thanks, bro.
You don't have a brother, right?
Yes.
Want me to be your brother?
Want to be my little brother?
-We'll see.
Don't want it? Then don't do it.
Brother....
I'll do it.

Subtitles (Rough Translation) Fly-5
They should have surrendered when they had the chance!
Don't tell me, with only one machine...
So this means that the creatures of Area 18 have fallen, right? Princess, about the mobilization effort...
Sorry, I'll have you accompany me in finishing it.
No need.
Your section has been secured.
Area 11 will be difficult to handle.
I understand.
I will find you, Zero... to avenge Clovis!
I'm home.
Welcome home, Lelouch.
Welcome home, brother.
From the looks of it, you've already ate dinner.
I was worried.
I thought that you might have been caught up in the chaos that person named Zero caused.
I called you, but I couldn't reach you.
Brother? C.C.-san came all the way here to see you...
C.C.?
Your friend is quite interesting, having only initials for a name.
Yeah...
Could it be... that she's your girlfriend? Huh?
Our futures are intertwined with one another, right?
By future, do you mean marriage?
No!
No, it's not like that.
So, um... she's kidding... I hate jokes.
I see.
I'm surprised at how quickly you decided, brother.
But they say, "To each his own", so it may not be that strange, I suppose.
Ah, what are you doing C.C.?
You're all wet.
Here, you need to go to the bathroom.
I'll get you a change of clothes too.
Nanali, I'll clean it up right away, so stay right there.
A lie, a joke.
Who are you?
I'm C.C.
That's not what I mean. You're...
Do you like it?
The power I gave you.
As I thought, you're... Are you unsatisfied?
No, I'm grateful.
You pushed my schedule forward a great deal.
Schedule?
The plan to destroy Britannia.
I thought that it would be a little while longer before I could make my move.
Do you think you can destroy it with just that power?
I was planning to do this even without it.
As expected, you're an interesting person.
What are you going to do from now on?
You're being pursued by the military, aren't you?
Even if you say the military, it's only a small portion of it.
It's enough if I just keep a low profile. I'll put up with it here.
Hey, you're planning on staying here?
Men sleep on the floor.
That's not the point...
If I get caught, you'll have problems too, won't you? Being together is even more dangerous.
If I sleep out there, I will be caught.
Not at your convenience, but at mi-
I hate persistent people.
You're being very careless about this.
More importantly, how did you survive?
Fukushima, Kouchi, Hiroshima.
This makes it seven incidences since Zero appeared.
After Zero appeared, other groups apparently became more hard-working.
Because of that "orange" incident, substitute supervisor Jeremiah has lost his leadership.
He doesn't have the ability to do it.
Thanks to that, the cooperation with the police and unions are in shambles.
It's quite an inconvenience for us as well.
Lend us your strength, Toudou!
Thanks to Zero, Britannia is in a state of confusion!
Now is the time that we, the Japan Liberation Front, should make a stand!
The information that Kyoto is giving the Crimson Brocade to Zero is not definitive.
If you concentrate on Zero too much, they will pull the rug out from under you!
Hey, in the end, what did "orange" mean? What?
You won't answer anyone's questions at all, but you'll ask me questions, huh?
If you don't want to answer me, then you don't have to.
Just like me.
"Orange" was just a casual remark. But...
There are those who will want it to mean something and will start to analyze it.
The entire world is searching for you.
The entire world is moving because of you. Lelouch, is this what you wanted to see?
No, this disturbance is merely part of the calculation.
The world will plunge into an even greater chaos.
Private Kururugi Suzaku of the district 11 military, case 1075, concerning the suspicion of Prince Clovis' murder.
We declare you acquitted due to lack of evidence.
Why... all of a sudden?
Look out!
Um... are you injured, or something?
I'm sorry! I didn't think there would be anyone below. Oh... no...
I didn't think that a girl would be falling from above either.
Oh?
Is... something wrong?
Yes! Something is wrong!
Eh?
To tell you the truth, I'm being chased by bad people. So, can you please help me?
We cannot allow that "orange" to affect Princess Cornelia's arrival.
At this rate, the loyalty of us, the Purists, will be questioned.
That Sir Jeremiah is wild... Then what is "orange"?
At any rate, it's a fact that Sir Jeremiah is guilty.
Saying that he does not remember anything... it's the same excuse as Patre!
Sir Jeremiah's memories are jumbled.
I haven't introduced myself yet, have I?
I am...
Yuffie? Yes. I am...
You shouldn't do that. You're famous.
The son of former Captain Kururugi, Private Kururugi Suzaku.
It was a lie, right?
The story about being chased by bad people.
Meow.
Meow meow?
Are you hurt, meow?
Meow meow meow~
Meow?
Meow?
Oh my.
We're late, I hope he's waiting for us.
But was he really acquitted?
Well, it looks like he was thoroughly investigated, thanks to that incident with Zero...
Oh, why...? Huh?
Well, I like them, but...
It appears to be a one-sided love.
Kind people are the ones who have one-sided loves.
It ran off.
Yuffie?
Why did you lie just now?
Are you concerned about me? Eh?
When we're like this, it doesn't seem too different from being in Britannia.
You're from the motherland, Yuffie? Yes!
I was a student up until last week.
Until last week? Then, what are you now?
By student, do you mean a high-schooler?
You can go sightseeing whenever you want, right?
You ask a lot questions, don't you?
Oh, sorry.
Ah, no, that's not what I meant... Um... today is my last day off, so I wanted to see what sort of place Area 11 is.
Then it didn't have to be me...
No, I'm glad it was you. Oh, I see...
Suzaku-san, could you take me to one more place?
You may request anything of me, princess.
Then to Shinjuku...
Please show me Shinjuku, Kururugi Suzaku-san.
Lelouch-kun.
Are you busy right now? Hm? What is it?
It's about that phone call from before.
Phone call?
Um... you know, that time in the bathroom...
Ahh. Do you know if there are call logs?
I want to contact that person.
It's the school's phone, so I don't think...
I see...
I thought so too...
That woman...
Hey...
Hm?
To return to the motherland like this...
I shouldn't have gotten involved with that woman...
Are you an idiot? Don't just go wandering around!
I'm okay as long as I'm within the school grounds.
No, you're an outsider here.
I'm an outsider no matter where I go.
What's with that person?
Oh.
I placed a Geass on her which makes her carve a symbol on this wall every day.
Geass? This power.
During the contract, that's what I heard.
A test to find out the length of duration, huh?
It's best to understand the specs of your weapon, isn't it?
If you're too uncontrollable, then...
I wonder if it would work on me?
Don't worry.
You and I are accomplices.
The Shinjuku ghetto is finished.
Aw...
As I thought, they won't use the RG's against Elevens.
Hey, over here.
It's the aftermath.
Hurry up and take the picture!
I know!
Take a picture of me next! Me too!
Is that true?
The information about Zero.
Yes, it is information from Sir Curel. All right.
Put a cordon on the 4th Zone of the Shinjuku Ghetto.
Understood, Sir.
Sir Curel... we will leave the rest up to you.
I wanted you to contact Sir Jeremiah, but it seems you probably won't, isn't that right?
Get out of here, you Britannian pigs!
Stay here!
Wh-What?
You're just an Eleven!
We're Japanese!
Don't call us Elevens! What are you saying?
You guys lost to us, you dogs of a defeated country!
Why you Britannian...
Please stop!
Don't get in the way!
This guy...
You... are you Kururugi Suzaku?
Kururugi, the guy who killed Clovis?
You idiot! The one who did it was Zero!
This guy is just a slave.
So what if he's an honored Britannian?
Acting so happy...
Selling your pride, comrades and soul...
Are you even Japanese?
!
That's not it! I... That IS it!
Please stop!
I'm an individual who has received training.
Don't fight with your comrades anymore...
What do you mean by comrade?
That traitor...
Suzaku!
Are you all right?
Yes.
It's not okay!
My Prime G and MX 4 are...
Jeez, for being honored...
Why did you let them go?
! You should have finished them off!
You've killed many Elevens before anyway, haven't you?
I will not allow you to insult this man any further!
In order to use the Geass, one must look directly into the opponents' eyes.
There is no problem penetrating through glasses.
Maximum distance is about 270 meters. After having the Geass cast on them, or when it's in effect, there is a noticeable gap in memory.
This is thought to be damage caused by the Geass invading the cerebrum.
If it has the property of light, then reflection is also possible.
You sure have studied it a lot in such a short amount of time. The opponent is an empire which has subdued over a third of the world.
There is no such thing as exercising too much discretion.
Understandable for Elevens, but you're Britannian, aren't you? Britannia is much too large and powerful of an opponent to fight with just one Geass.
I wonder if it's bad to be weak.
At that time... for us 10 year olds, the world appeared to be a very sad place.
Fear.
Sickness.
Corruption.
Decay. Discrimination.
War and terrorism.
The repeated chain of hatred.
A foolish vicious cycle. Someone must break this chain asunder.
Quite an idealist. Of course, I don't think that it is possible to get rid of all of that.
I'm not that arrogant.
That's why...
I would at least like a world without war.
A place where we won't lose dear ones.
Such a convenient world...
What can you do to...
If someone wins, the fighting will end.
I don't know yet.
But if I stop aiming for something, my father will have died in vain.
Captain Kururugi's...? In that war, my father HAD to die!
Jeremiah! Today, we will make you pay for the sin of allowing the murderer of Prince Clovis to escape!
Cowardly Curel!
So the information that you found Zero was a lie! Before Princess Cornelia arrives, we must cleanse the shame of our fellow men!
Jeremiah, this is a purge!
Suzaku-kun!
Cecil-san!
It's dangerous here! Get on!
The Purists are having an internal conflict.
Let's hurry up and get out of here.
Oh, and sorry about interrupting your little get together.
You'll have to do it another time.
Please wait! Wouldn't this be a good chance to get battle data on the Lancelot?
Suzaku...
Sorry, Yuffie... we must bid farewell to each other here.
I have to go.
If I have Lancelot, I should be able to stop them.
Dammit... four on one...
Cowards!
Don't worry, Jeremiah.
We'll treat you like a warrior.
There will be no shame to your family name!
Are you serious? Are you seriously going to kill me, Curel?
!
Be silent, "orange"!
Why do you think we exist?
It's for the Imperial House, is it not? ! All hail Britannia!
Please stop!
Don't fight amongst yourselves as Britannians! That's... the honored Britannian...
The Collaborative Weapon, Lancelot!
What does a special envoy want?
If you are going to interfere, we'll kill you regardless of who you are!
I can't allow a meaningless fight to go on!
MVS stands for Maser Vibration Swords. MVS?
!
So they were already implemented...
But, I'm not backing down!
He's going to save me?
Even if I can just take out "orange"...
Sir Jeremiah!
Is that Viletta?
Do you still plan on fighting?
Everyone back off.
Curel...
So we've come to an understanding? I'll use the Chaos Bomb.
Stop!
That honored Britannian...
Using his own body as a shield... Both sides, lower your weapons!
I will command you in my name!
I-It cannot be... I am the 3rd Imperial Princess of Britannia, Euphemia le Britannia!
Eh...
Yuffie...? I will take control of this area.
Stand down!
As I thought... the Imperial Princess...
Did you know that, Lloyd-san?
Yeah. She rarely appeared to the public because she was a student.
I-I am truly...
I am truly sorry!
Imperial Princess!
On top of me not even being aware, I have been acting extremely rude to you.
Suzaku...
Just as you lost your father, I have lost my older brother, Clovis.
Will you lend me your strength so that others can get by without losing their loved ones?
Yes! Your kind words are more than I am worthy of!
I heard about it, Euphemia.
Don't do such reckless things.
I'm sorry, sister.
However...
While we are here, call me Governor-General, Vice-Governor Euphemia.
A distinction is needed precisely because we are true siblings.
Yes, I understand.
Also, concerning the measures being taken...
Yes, the preparations for the welcoming of the Imperial Princess are being readied in the government office...
You are lacking.
You are weak.
You are being sluggish.
What of Zero?
Capture the enemy of the empire's people!
Zero!
Eh?
From today on, I will be a student at Ashford Academy.
I'm Kururugi Suzaku.
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah, I know.
I'm lying.
To Shirley and Rival...
Even to Suzaku and Nanali.
But...
I can't go back...
I can't return.
If C.C. is my accomplice, then I have to use that.
Because I don't want to lie to myself any longer.
I want you to help me understand what made Western civilization dominate the world for the Iast 500 years.
Why did the West dominate the rest?
Shakir?
- First of all, they had guns.
- Guns?
And everyone else had bows and arrows.
They had the attitude that they should probably get on boats - and go and invade other countries.
- exploration.
Getting in boats.
NIALL FERGUSON: Around 500 years ago, a band of intrepid sailors and soldiers from the petty warring kingdoms of medieval Europe changed the world.
Thirsting after conquest, commerce, colonisation and conversion, they exported their civilization from their little nook of Western Eurasia to every corner of the globe.
Before long, Western civilization became the world's dominant civilization.
The West taught the rest its way of doing business... its scientific method... its law and its politics, its way of dressing... of speaking and of praying.
The big story is that after 1500, the West essentially dominated the rest.
And it's a story we ignore at our peril, because today, after half a millennium of tilting westwards, the world seems inexorably to be tilting to the East.
China's pot is to become the world's biggest economy.
islam could soon overtake Christianity as mankind's favourite faith.
So, does all this mean that Western civilization itself could soon be history?
The only way to answer that question is to understand how the West came to be so powerful in the first place.
The thing of education.
If you've got the right education...
The amount of land that a country controls.
With trade, with the introduction of trade... NIALL:
I think we could simplify it.
I have boiled it down to six things and I'm going to call them the six killer applications - the killer apps - that made the West dominate the rest.
The first one is competition.
Number two killer app is science.
Democracy, medicine, consumerism.
The work ethic, which you obviously all have.
Understanding how the West beat the rest gives us an insight not just into the past but also into the future, and I think you'II agree, it helps answer the question that could be the most important of our time.
Are we the generation on whose watch Western ascendancy is going to end?
We tend to assume that our civilization, the one that's dominated the world for so long, will last for ever.
It's easy to forget that Western civilization has declined and fallen once before.
The ancient Roman ruins here at Caesarea in israel are a pretty potent reminder of that.
In the space of just a generation, in the fifth century AD, the Roman Empire in Western Europe essentially fell apart - the aqueducts dried up, the roads overgrown, the circuses deserted.
Question - could something similar happen to Western civilization 2.0 - the version that, after a millennium of stagnation, rose to dominate the world?
Beset by economic crises and by environmental fears, the West today is also waking up to a growing Eastern challenge to its political and military supremacy.
The evidence is here in China.
The biggest and fastest industrial revolution ever, compressed into just 30 years.
A self-confident one-party state.
A culture reasserting itself on the world stage.
The ascent of China looks like being the defining political event of the 21 st century.
It's almost as if the clock is being wound back 600 years, to the last time China led the world.
The Forbidden City in Beijing.
Built by the Ming dynasty in the early 1 5th century, these awe-inspiring buildings are a reminder of the last time China was a global leader.
They remain as relics of one of the greatest civilizations in all history.
But they're also a reminder that no civilization lasts for ever.
Within a century of their construction, the decline of the East and the rise of the West had begun.
500 years ago, something quite extraordinary happened.
The impoverished, petty, strife-torn kingdoms of Western Europe embarked on five centuries of uninterrupted expansion.
meanwhile, the magnificent empires of the Orient, exemplified by Beijing's Forbidden City, stagnated and then succumbed to Western dominance.
By 1900, if not earlier, the Westerners had effectively subjugated the Resterners.
In 1 500, Western Europe had accounted for only 1 0% of the world's land surface and, at most, 1 6% of its population.
By 1 91 3, 1 1 Western empires controlled more than half of all territory and population and a staggering 80% of global economic output.
As recently as the 1 980s, the average American was 7 0 times richer than the average Chinese.
We tend to assume that it was Western technology that trumped the East... in particular, the technology that went on to produce the industrial Revolution.
But it wasn't that.
The real killer app that the West had and the rest lacked was competition, both political and economic.
And the consequences - the birth of the nation-state and the rise of capitalism - would lead to a remarkable reversal of fortunes.
This is history's greatest revelation - how it was that Europeans, not Chinese, came to run the world.
What would you have seen if you'd taken two trips along two rivers in the year 1 420?
The Thames and the Yangtze.
The Yangtze was part of a vast waterway known as the Grand Canal that linked Hangzhou with Beijing 1,000 miles to the north.
The restoration and improvement of the canal was part of a plan to stimulate China's economy, masterminded by the formidable Ming emperor known as Yongle.
This is the Precious belt Bridge at Suzhou, with its 53 arches, one of the architectural marvels of the Grand canal.
In the reign of Emperor YongIe, which means, literally, "perpetual happiness", 15,000 barges used to sail up and down it every year.
Venice, eat your heart out.
When the intrepid Venetian Marco Polo had visited China in the 1 27 0s, he'd been astonished by the volume of traffic on the Yangtze.
"The multitude of vessels that invest this river is so great "that no-one who should read or hear would believe it.
"The quantity of merchandise carried up and down is past all belief.
"ln fact, it is so big, that it seems to be a sea rather than a river. "
400 miles upstream from the South China Sea,
Yongle controlled his vast empire from the Imperial capital, Nanjing.
With a population of up to a million, the city was probably the largest in the world.
YongIe didn't believe in doing anything by halves.
This is just one volume of the vast encyclopaedia of Chinese literature and learning which he commissioned.
There were 1 1 ,095 volumes in total, and it was compiled by a team of 2,000 scholars.
It was surpassed as the world's largest encyclopaedia only in 2007, after a reign of 600 years... by Wikipedia.
But Yongle was not content with Nanjing.
He resolved to build a new and more spectacular capital to the north, in Beijing.
By 1 420, when the Forbidden City was at last complete,
Ming China had an incontrovertible claim to be the most advanced civilization in the world.
It really did seem as if the Emperor Yongle ruled over "All Under Heaven".
Contrast Yongle's realm with that of his contemporaries,
Richard ll or Henry V.
They ruled over a land that was in some ways still mired in the Dark Ages.
Its mightiest river, the Thames, was, let's be frank, a primitive backwater.
Yes, I know we're taught to think of Henry V as one of the great heroes of english history, but I'm afraid his kingdom was very far from the "sceptred isle"
of Shakespeare's famous play.
More like a septic isle.
There were, of course, some imposing sights on the banks of the Thames, notably a large gaol, the Tower of London.
But a visitor from Nanjing would scarcely have been impressed.
The Tower of London was a pretty primitive edifice compared with the splendours of the great towers of imperial China.
London's old, patched-up city walls extended a paltry three miles.
By contrast, it took the founder of the Ming dynasty 21 years to build a wall more than 20 miles long around his capital city, Nanjing.
The gate where I'm sitting could house more than 3,000 soldiers.
And as you can see, this was serious bricks and mortar, built to last.
By 1 5th-century standards, Nanjing was a pretty pleasant place to live.
London wasn't.
The ravages of the Black Death, the bubonic plague that had devastated Europe in the early 1 4th century, had reduced the city's population to around 40,000, less than a 20th the size of Nanjing's.
English life expectancy at birth was a miserable 37 years.
Henry V himself became King at the age of 26, and was dead from dysentery by 35 - a reminder, by the way, that most history is made by young people.
The ones that survived, that is.
Roughly one in five English children died in the first year of life.
In London, the figure was nearly one in three.
Violence was endemic.
When not fighting the French, the English fought the Welsh, the Scots and the Irish... or themselves.
Between 1 330 and 1 479, a quarter of deaths in the English aristocracy were violent.
Life in this period really was, as Thomas Hobbes famously said,
"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short".
It was also incredibly unhygienic by oriental standards.
Without any proper sewage system, medieval London stank to high heaven, whereas human excrement was routinely collected in Chinese cities and spread on outlying fields.
When he was Lord Mayor of London, which was four times between 1397 and his death in 1 423,
Dick Whittington had to watch where he put his feet, because the streets of his city were paved with something very different from gold.
And England was probably the most prosperous European country.
Life was even nastier, more brutal and shorter in France.
No, 600 years ago, the idea of a civilized West would have seemed absurd.
The future of humanity surely lay in the East.
But why was the East so far ahead?
Long before the industrial Revolution came to England, China was amazingly inventive.
You probably thought Jethro tull, the english agricultural pioneer, invented the seed drill.
But no, the Chinese got there 2,000 years ago.
In fact, before 1 400, there was a veritable alphabet of Chinese inventions.
Astronomical observatories.
Card games.
The clock.
This is the biggest water clock in China.
Now, it's not really clear if the Egyptians, the babylonians or the Chinese invented the water clock.
But it was utterly transformed in 1 086 by the great Chinese inventor Su Song.
Su Song combined it with a gear-driven escapement to create the world's first mechanical clock.
Nothing remotely so accurate existed in england until the 1 4th century.
Time really did seem to be on China's side.
Football.
Gunpowder.
Ink.
Matches.
Paper.
The printing press.
15th-century Germany?
More like 1 1th-century China.
The suspension bridge.
China, 2,000 years ago.
Not to mention the wheelbarrow.
And that's not all.
As a new century dawned in 1 400, the emperor YongIe had another transport technology at his disposal, which had the potential to make him master, not just of the middle Kingdom, but of the entire global market.
It was time for imperial China to set sail.
Now, that's what I call a ship.
What they're building here in Nanjing is a fuII-scaIe replica of one of the treasure ships of admiral Zheng He - the most famous sailor in Chinese history, the man who very nearly turned the middle Kingdom into a global empire.
By the time they've finished, it'II be 400 feet in length.
That's ten times the size of the Santa Maria, the ship that columbus sailed across the atlantic Ocean in 1 492.
And there wasn't just one of them.
Zheng He set sail in command of a crew of some 28,000 men in a fleet of dozens of these enormous ships.
Zheng He was an unusual man.
Captured in battle at the age of 1 1, he was castrated and assigned as a servant to the man who would seize the Imperial throne as Yongle.
Yongle and Zheng He would become one of the great double acts of Chinese history.
Between 1 405 and 1 424, admiral Zheng He's fleet ranged far and wide.
They sailed to CaIicut, to malacca, to CeyIon, to Sumatra, to Hormuz, to Aden...
Some scholars speculate they reached as far as northern australia, the Cape of Good Hope and greenland, and all this was years before the European Age of exploration had so much as begun.
The main purpose of these visits was not so much to trade, but to assert Chinese supremacy.
Who could refuse to kowtow to an emperor possessed of so mighty a fleet?
In 1 415, Zheng He reached the coast of East Africa.
In a short time, the fleet was loaded up with representatives of 30 different kings and chiefs ready to acknowledge the cosmic ascendancy of the Ming emperor.
Down below were stowed a host of exotic animals.
The sultan of MaIindi chose a giraffe to send.
Yongle personally received the animal at the gateway of the Imperial Palace in Nanjing.
The giraffe was hailed as a symbol of perfect virtue, perfect government and perfect harmony in the empire and the universe.
In many ways, the giraffe perfectly symboIised the zenith of Chinese prestige in the world.
And then, in 1 424, came news that would fundamentally change not only the history of China, but the history of the world itself.
The Emperor YongIe had died, and with him died the dream of Chinese overseas expansion.
Within just a few years, China turned in on itself.
The death of Yongle had an immediate and dramatic impact.
Under his successors, Zheng He's voyages were suspended.
From 1 500, anyone in China found building a ship with more than two masts was liable to the death penalty.
In 1 551, it became a crime even to go to sea on a multi-masted ship.
The records of Zheng He's voyages were destroyed.
The tomb of Emperor YongIe at ChangIing is an appropriate place to reflect on the huge opportunity that China missed.
What lay behind the momentous decision to turn inwards?
Was it fiscal trouble or political wrangles at the imperial court?
Was it because a war in Annam, modern-day Vietnam, turned out to be more expensive than anyone had expected?
Or was it just Confucian suspicion of the so-caIIed strange things that admiral Zheng He had brought home with him?
We may never know.
Like the Apollo moon missions,
Zheng He's voyages were carried out at enormous expense.
They were a formidable demonstration of power and technological sophistication.
But beyond that, to be blunt, they turned out to be pretty pointless.
Landing a Chinese eunuch on the East African coast was essentially the same as landing an American on the moon - pretty impressive.
But so what?
What was important was what you did when you got there.
China's failure to exploit its advantages left the path of overseas expansion wide open for the West.
When the new emperor called home Zheng He's mighty navy, he virtually guaranteed that it wouId be the West's version of civilization that would sweep the globe.
Size isn't everything.
Admiral Zheng He's enormous ships and his emperor's grandiose ambitions had done precious little for China.
How very different it would be for the altogether more modest voyages about to be undertaken by a remarkable man from the tiny little European kingdom of Portugal.
His name was Vasco da Gama.
Da Gama made his country's - and his own - fortune by cornering the market in the 1 5th century's favourite food additive spices.
For centuries, the old spice route ran from the Indian Ocean over land across the Arabian peninsula, into the Ottoman Empire, and then from Venice into Europe.
It was entirely dominated by the Arabs, the Turks and the Venetians.
The Portuguese had the brilliant idea that if they could find an alternative route, all the way around the coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope and into the Indian Ocean... then this business could be theirs.
It was here in the Castle of St George in the hills above Lisbon that the newly crowned Portuguese King Manuel appointed da Gama to command a fleet of ships, to make discoveries and go in search of spices.
King manuel's orders to Vasco da Gama tell us something very important about the overseas spread of Western civilization.
As we'II see, there was more than one killer app, but the one that really started the ball rolling was surely competition - both the main driver of capitalism and of the fragmented European state system.
For Europeans, exploration was the Iate-15th-century space race.
Or rather, spice race.
Da Gama set sail from this spot on 8th july, 1 497.
When he and his fellow sailors rounded the Cape of Good Hope, the southernmost tip of Africa, they weren't wondering, as the Chinese had, if they could find some exotic animals to take home to their king.
They were wondering if they could make money there.
In 1 498, more than 80 years after the Chinese explorer Zheng He had landed at Malindi on the Kenyan coast, Vasco da Gama turned up.
He wasn't here to impress the locals, much less to hunt giraffe.
He immediately saw Malindi's potential as a trading post.
By 1 506, the Portuguese had a near monopoly on shipping along the East African coast.
This wasn't the only difference between the Chinese and the Portuguese.
There was also a streak of ruthlessness, of downright nastiness, about these Portuguese explorers that Zheng He seldom evinced.
The Portuguese knew they were eating someone else's lunch along with their spices.
But they were ready to meet any resistance with cannon fire and cutlass.
This is the tomb of Vasco da Gama here in St Jerome's monastery in Lisbon.
Da Gama died in 1524 of a fever, but that didn't mark the end of Portuguese ambitions.
explorers like him pressed on beyond India, as far as China.
The great reversal of fortunes was now unstoppable.
Along with Portugal, Spain had been first off the mark, seizing the initiative in the New World.
The Dutch weren't far behind, building up a hugely profitable trading company by following the spice route to Indonesia.
They, in turn, were closely followed by the French.
And what of the english, whose territorial ambitions had once extended no further than France and whose one big economic idea had been to sell wool to the italians?
How could they possibly sit on the sidelines with news coming in that their archenemies, the Spaniards, were making a killing overseas?
By the 1 7th century, the Thames was no longer a provincial backwater.
It was the hub of Britain's burgeoning overseas empire.
The docks at Deptford were producing ocean-going ships by the dozen.
In 1 635, the first English merchantman arrived in Chinese waters.
Once, when Zheng He had sailed the high seas, China had been able to regard distant Europeans with indifference, if not contempt.
Now trading rivalry had brought the barbarians to China.
And with each new trading post, each new warehouse, each new fort,
Western civilization uploaded its unique killer app of commercial competition.
The question is, why did the Europeans have that fervour when the Chinese didn't?
Why was Vasco da Gama so clearly hungry for money - hungry enough to kill for it?
well, you can find the answer here in the bowels of the British Library by looking at wonderful old maps like this one, which is of the city-state of Lubeck, dating back to 1530.
It's just one long - very long - celebration of local autonomy.
And it was a pattern repeated throughout Europe.
In Venice, La Serenissima, here in Frankfurt, on the banks of the River Main... and, of course, in London itself. It wasn't just London pride.
AII the great European cities were proud of their own autonomy.
I can't help feeling the message of these maps is "divide and rule", except that it was by being divided that the Europeans ended up ruling the rest of the world.
small was beautiful in the middle Ages, because smaIIness meant competition.
Competition between states and, within states, between companies.
Compare that with China, with its one monolithic empire.
Whereas in China power was centralised in the hands of the emperor, in Northern Europe particularly, there was an astonishing decentralisation.
Hundreds of states and city-states competing against each other.
In England, the most important commercial centre in the country was almost completely autonomous.
The City of London Corporation can trace its origins back to the 12th century.
That means that the lord mayor, the sheriffs, the city council, the freemen, the Iiverymen and the aldermen are all more than 800 years old, making this the world's oldest autonomous commercial institution.
In many ways, it's the forerunner of today's multinational corporations.
In other ways, it's the forerunner of democracy itself.
The City was never in awe of the Crown, and the wealthier the City became, the more leverage it had.
Loans to the Crown became the key to urban autonomy.
And the masters of the medieval universe were the livery companies.
And that's where power used to lie - with the drapers, the goldsmiths, the grocers, the haberdashers, ironmongers, mercers, the saIters, the shearers, the skinners - not forgetting the tailors and the vintners.
Dating back to the middle Ages, they're a reminder of the amazing power - economic and political - that used to be wielded by London's craftsmen and merchants.
And craftsmanship brings us back to that great Chinese invention the clock.
So this was the cutting edge of timekeeping technology. Yes, totally correct.
No-one else in the world could match the skills or abilities of the english cIockmaker.
There's no better metaphor for the relentless shift of global power than the clock.
The English mechanical clock was not only more accurate than the Chinese water clock - it was also designed to be sold widely, rather than monopolised by the emperor's astronomers. IAN:
clocks often were made for a story, and this clock,
Nebuchadnezzar is sleeping in the Ieft-hand corner of the screen... - NIALL: Oh, yes.
- IAN: ...and he's having a dream.
The axeman is chopping the tree of Iife down - and the whole world will come to an end, and we'II all die.
Is this the kind of clock that you sent to foreigners to impress them? That is exactly it.
You're showing off your technology is better than theirs.
The rise of the clock, and later the portable watch, went hand in hand with the rise of Europe and the spread of Western civilization.
And with every new individual timepiece, a little bit more time ran out for the age of oriental predominance.
While Europe was a patchwork quilt,
China remained a vast monochrome blanket.
Not even the most pretentious European court could match the Ming dynasty's authority.
The Forbidden City in Beijing is just one vast monument to the unity of Imperial power.
Just take a walk from the Protecting Harmony hall to the middle Harmony hall, where the emperor had his private quarters, to the hall of Supreme Harmony, where the Dragon Throne itself sat. Harmony, harmony, harmony.
It's a kind of codeword for unity, for undivided imperial authority.
This simply had no counterpart among the fractured and competing states and cities of 1 5th-century Europe.
In China, Imperial rule was implemented by a Confucian bureaucracy, recruited on the basis of perhaps the most terrifying set of exam papers in all history.
This photograph is of the central examination compound in Nanjing.
Thousands of wannabe mandarins would be locked in these cells, just three-and-a-half feet deep, about the same width, and only five-and-a-half feet high.
During the time an examination lasted, the only movement allowed was the passage of servants, replenishing food and water supplies, or removing human waste.
Some candidates went completely insane under the pressure.
No doubt after nine long days shut in a shoebox, it was the most able, and the certainly most indefatigable, candidates who passed the imperial examination.
But this was an exam that rewarded caution, even conformity.
It was competitive, certainly, but not the kind of competition that fosters innovation, much less the appetite for change.
Confucius said, among other things, that,
"The common man marvels at uncommon things.
"The wise man marvels at the commonplace."
But maybe there was just a bit too much that was commonplace about the way that Ming China was governed.
And in a world that refused to stand still, that was a recipe for trouble. Big trouble.
(GONG)
Great empires are complex things.
For centuries they can bask in a sweet spot of power and prosperity.
But then, often quite suddenly, they can collapse.
Let's look again at what happened to Imperial China.
The Ming dynasty had been born in 1 368, and as we've seen, for more than a century after that,
Ming China was the world's most sophisticated civilization by almost any measure.
But then, in the mid-1 7th century, the wheels came flying off.
Political factionalism, fiscal crisis and famine opened the door to rebellion and invasion.
The results were devastating.
Conflict and disease reduced the Chinese population by as much as 40%.
In 1 644, the last Ming emperor hanged himself out of shame.
This dramatic transition from Confucian equipoise to anarchy had taken little more than a decade.
What had gone wrong?
well, the answer is that turning inwards proved fatal for a complex and densely populated society like China's.
The Ming system had created a kind of high-equiIibrium trap.
OutwardIy it was very impressive, but on the inside it was highly fragile.
The least little thing caused the trap to snap shut because there were no external resources to draw on.
And that explains why Zheng He, the personification of early Chinese expansionism, for so long forgotten, is a hero in today's newly gIobaIised China.
In the words of China's great economic reformer of the 1 980s,
Deng Xiaoping, "No country that wishes to become developed today "can pursue closed-door policies.
"When Zheng He sailed the Western Ocean, our country was open.
"After Yongle died, the dynasty went into decline "and became backward and mired in darkness and ignorance. "
That's a plausible reading of history.
As England's population growth accelerated in the late 1 7th century, trade brought an influx of new nutrients like potatoes and sugar, while colonisation allowed the emigration of surplus people.
Over time, the effect was to raise productivity, incomes, nutrition and even height.
In contrast, by turning away from foreign trade and intensifying rice cultivation, the Chinese were stuck with rising population, falling incomes and declining nutrition, height and productivity.
The English got better stimulants, too.
They got the coffee house while the Chinese got the opium den.
In 1 793, the 1 st Earl Macartney led an expedition to the Qianlong Emperor, in a vain effort to persuade the Chinese to re-open their empire to trade.
Macartney brought with him ample tribute the most advanced scientific instruments, including the finest clocks that England could make.
As he later wrote,
"The emperor and his minions were unimpressed.
"lt was discovered that the taste for science, "if it ever existed, was now completely worn out.
"This intricate workmanship was all lost "and thrown away on the ignorant Chinese. "
Unrepentant in his isolation, the emperor addressed a dismissive message to King George lll.
"There is nothing we lack.
"We have never set much store on strange or ingenious objects. "
Except maybe those nice English clocksl I'm standing here in the heart of the Forbidden City entirely surrounded by clocks.
It's just that all these clocks were either manufactured by or designed by EngIishmen.
Nothing could better symboIise the transition of power from East to West.
The Chinese had invented the mechanical clock, but now the imperial court was reduced to accepting superior timepieces as gifts from Europeans.
And when they broke down, the Chinese couldn't even mend them.
The West's ascendancy was perfectly symbolised in June 1 842, when British ships sailed up the Yangtze to the Grand Canal in retaliation for the destruction of opium by a zealous Chinese official.
China had to pay an indemnity of 21 million silver dollars, cede the island of Hong Kong, and open five ports to British trade, including this one.
This is one of the great outposts of British penetration of Asia - the Shanghai Bund.
The old headquarters of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank used to be described as the most luxurious building between the Suez canal and the Bering Strait.
It was ironic, but perhaps appropriate, that the first "unequal treaty" between Britain and China was signed here at the Jinghai Temple, built by the Emperor Yongle more than four centuries before, in honour of Admiral Zheng He,
master and commander of the last imperial super-ship.
Today, they're building ocean-going ships again in China vast ships capable of bringing back the raw materials necessary to feed China's insatiably growing industrial economy.
Competition, markets, profits, capitalism - these are things that China once turned its back on.
Well, not any more.
I'm standing on a crane in the biggest shipyard in China.
Now, if 30 years ago, you'd predicted that China's would be the second largest economy by 201 1 and the largest by 2030, I think you'd have been dismissed as a fantasist.
But it wouId have seemed equally fantastic in 1 420 to have predicted Western ascendancy.
The point is that in the course of the 15th century,
Europeans discovered the joys of competition, both economic and political.
And in a competition for control of the Asian spice trade, capitalism was born and, with it, the foundation for a world dominated by Western civilization.
The kind of economically driven civilization that today seems to be working rather better in the East.
Yet competition was only one of the killer apps of Western dominance.
In the next episode of civilization, I'll ask why it was that the scientific revolution happened only in the West, and failed to take off even in those parts of the Eastern world that had once been pioneers of mathematics and astronomy.
Why, in short, was there no Isaac Newton in Istanbul?
Long ago, in the Year of Our Lord 326 A.D., a great prophet is leader of the Nephite people in ancient upstate New York.
His name... is Mormon.
I... am Mormon.
My people sailed here from Israel to create a new civilization.
These golden plates tell of our people and how we met with...
Jesus Christ.
I... am Jesus.
Take care of your golden plates, Mormon, for soon, your entire civilization will be gone and nobody will remember you.
Just before the Nephite people were wiped out, Mormon gave the plates to his son, Moroni.
I... am Moroni, the last of my kind.
I shall bury the golden plates, father, and perhaps one day someone very special will find them.
And lo, Moroni buried the golden plates high on a hill.
Centuries later the golden plates were found, giving birth to the fastest-growing religion today!
A church that even now sends missionaries out all over the world!

I can't believe the day is finally here!
We're gonna get to go out and see the world!
Do you have any idea where they're sending you, Elder Price?
Well of course we don't really have final say over where we get sent, but... I have been praying to be sent to my favorite place in the whole world.
Oh, well if you prayed for a location, I'm sure Heavenly Father will make it happen.
You're like the smartest, best, most deserving elder this center has ever seen.
Aw come on guys.
The most important time of a Mormon kid's life is his mission.
A chance to go out and help heal the world, that's my mission
Soon I'll be off in a different place helping the whole human race
I know my mission will be something incredible!

We need to knock him off his perch!
We are the soldiers of the army of the Church ...of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints!
Elder Cross and Elder Green, you will be serving in...
Japan. Oh, Japan!
Land of soy sauce!
And Mothra!
Elder Harris and Elder Brown.
Heavenly Father, where will I go on my mission
(on my mission)? Will it be China or Old Mexico on my mission?
(mission)
It could be San Fran by the bay, Australia where they say "G'day", but I pray I'm sent to my favorite place:
Orlando (Orlando)

All right, elders, all right!
Go home and pack your things.
Tomorrow, your missions begin.
Bye you guys!
I am so stoked we got paired together, Elder Price.
Oho, me too.
This is... fantastic!
You know what? I prayed to Heavenly Father that we would get paired together.
He really does listen!
He answered your prayers?
Yep, my mom said "if Heavenly Father is proud of you, he'll always give you what you ask."
You and me for two years in Ukuhanda!
This is gonna be awesome!
Yes, well, if we have the Book of Mormon, it'll do those Africans a lot of good.
Well, see you tomorrow, companion.
Tomorrow is a Latter Day!
Goodbye, son. We're so proud of you.
Wow, I can't believe Kevin is going to Africa for two years...
I'm gonna miss my brother so much.
Aw I know. I'm gonna miss you guys too.
Hey, maybe we should see if there's anyway I could get transferred someplace a little bit closer to home, like uh...
Florida, or...
No, don't worry, son. Heavenly Father has a hand in everything.
He knows what's best.
He always knows.
You're right, dad.
I'm sure I'm gonna have an amazing time.
Alright son, just remember: do whatever Elder Price does.
He is a great Mormon, and you, well, you're a... great follower.
Right! I'm a follower.
Elder Price seems like a wonderful boy, Arnold!
Uh... oh, he is. We're gonna have the most amazing time together.
It's like, like I'm finally gonna have a best friend.
Ohoho, well, just remember what we talked about with regards to your little problem.
Oh don't worry Dad, my little problem is "in check." It's not gonna be an issue.
What's the little problem?
Oh, nothing.
He uh ju-, well, he has a very active imagination.
I lie a lot!
No!
It's just he sometimes makes things up when he doesn't know what else to say.
Bishop Donahue said it's because I have no self-esteem and desperately want to fit in with by my peers.
Well alright everybody,
I think it's time we leave these two to their work.
Boy you boys have a lot of catching up to do now that you're companions.
This is it, elders.
You're heading... to Africa.
Well how did you like that, boys? A real Lion King send-off.
We got Mrs. Brown to sing like an African for you.
Thanks, Dad.
That was great!
Well, good luck in Africa, boys! I've never been, But I hear it's a HOOT!
Well, goodbye, son, and please be careful.
Now you get out there and you baptize those Africans, boy!
Bye, Mrs. Brown!
Well? This is you and me now, companion.
Yup, that's right, elder.
From this point on, according to Rule #72, we are never allowed to go anywhere without each other.
Except the bathroom.
Yes, that's right.
This is so awesome!
Because all my friends always end up leaving me, but you can't!
Okay, favorite movies:
Are you a Star Wars guy or are you a Star Trek guy? I wanna know everything about you. Personally I like Star Wars, but I'm willing to like Star Trek if you think it's better?
Okay Elder, uh...
Look, I like to have fun just as much as the next guy, you know, but um, look, things are different now.
We are men. This is our time to prove that we are worthy.
Worthy of what?
Of everything we've been promised in the afterlife
I've always had the hope that on the day I go to heaven
Heavenly Father will shake my hand and say: "You've done an awesome job, Kevin"
Now it's our time to go out-
My best friend -to set the world's people free.
We can do it together, you and me, but mostly me!
You and me, but mostly me Are gonna change the world forever
'Cause I can do most anything
And I can stand next to you and watch
Every hero needs a sidekick Every captain needs a mate
- Every dinner needs a side dish
- On a slightly smaller plate
And now we're seeing eye to eye!
It's so great we can agree That Heavenly Father has chosen you and me Just mostly me
Something incredible I'll do something incredible
I wanna be the Mormon who changed all of mankind
My best friend
It's something I've foreseen And now that I'm nineteen
I'll do something incredible That blows God's freaking mind!
And as long as we stick together And I stay out of your way
Out of my way
We'll change the world forever
And make tomorrow a Latter Day!
Mostly me!
So quit thinking about it and do it
How ready and psyched are we?
And life is about to change for you And life is about to change for me And life is about to change for you and me
And there's no limit to what we can do...
Me and you...
But mostly...
Well, looks like we made it, huh?
Yeah, that was... that was one long trip.
I'll say!
Here we are in Kitguli, Uganda, and what do you think of Uganda, Elder?
Well uum, I think it's really different!
Yeah yeah! What have we here, maybe?
!
German?
British?
American.
Hello sir. Uh, we're here to see Mister Mafala Hatimbi.
Yeah. Your bags!
Oh uh, sir, we don't have anything illegal in there, sir.
Uh, we're from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
Here are some men with guns searching through our bags.
We take these bags!
What? This is your tariff... to the general!
The, the general?
Let I get one thi-
You shut the fuck up!
Omigosh! Okay- Just take the bags!
Why are you doing this?
Ahh, there you are!
I have been looking all over for you.
I am Mafala Hatimbi. I have been hired to show you to your building.
Look, some men just took our bags.
You must be very careful around here.
Now let's get going!
Uh no, uh, shouldn't you call the police and see if we can get our bags back?
Oho, the police...
The police are in Kampala, two days' drive away.
There's a lot of really important stuff in those bags.
Oh well, "Hasa Diga Eebowai."
'Scuse me?
You're in Northern Uganda now, and in this part of Africa, we all have a saying.
Whenever something bad happens, we just throw our hands to the sky and say "Hasa Diga Eebowai!"
Hasa Diga Eebowai?
It's the only way to get through all these troubled times.
There's war, poverty, famine...
But having a saying makes it all seem better!
There isn't enough food to eat Hasa Diga Eebowai
People are starving in the street Hasa Diga Eebowai
Hasa Diga Eebowai! Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Well, that's pretty neat!
Does it mean no worries for the rest of our days?
Kind of!
We've had no rain in several days (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
)
And eighty percent of us have AIDS (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
)
Many young girls here get circumcised Their clits get cut right off (Way oh!
And so we say up to the sky Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai! Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Now you try!
Just stand up tall, tilt your head to the sky, and list off the bad things in your life.
Somebody took our luggage away (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
The plane was crowded and the bus was late
(Hasa Diga Eebowai!
When the world is getting you down There's nobody else to blame (Way oh!
) Raise your middle finger to the sky And curse his rotten name
Wait, what?
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Am I saying that right?
Excuse me, sir, but what exactly does that phrase mean?
Well, let's see... "Eebowai" means "God", and "Hasa Diga" means "Fuck you!".
So I guess in English it would be, "Fuck you, God!" (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
)
What? !
When God fucks you in the butt, (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
)
Fuck God back right in his cunt (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai! What a nifty phrase!
Hasa Diga Eebowai Hasa Diga Eebowai
Hasa Diga Eebowai Hasa Diga Eebowai
You have to stop saying that!
What? Hasa Diga...
It means something very bad.
What?
They're saying F you to Heavenly Father!
F you Heavenly Father?
! Holy Moly! I said it like thirteen times!
Hasa Diga Eebowai! (Fuck you, God!
) Hasa Diga Eebowai!
(Fuck you, God!
Excuse me, sir, but you should really not be saying that.
Things aren't always as bad as they seem.
Oh, really?
Well, take this fucking asshole, Mutumbo, here.
He got caught last week trying to rape a baby.
What!
?
Why? Some people in his tribe believe that having sex with a virgin will cure their AIDS.
There aren't many virgins left, so some of them are turning to babies.
But... that's horrible!
I know!
(Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Here's the butcher, he has AIDS Here's the teacher, she has AIDS
Here's the doctor, he has AIDS – Here's my daughter she has A wonderful disposition!
She's all I have left in the world
And if either of you lays a hand on her...
If you don't like what we say Try living here a couple days
Watch all your friends and family die Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you!
Fuck you...
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a
Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a
Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a
Fuck you in the eye!
Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a
Fuck you in the other eye!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you, fuck you God Hasa Diga!
Fuck you God!
In the cunt!
Fuck you, God!
This is where my father asked me to bring you. The others like you should be inside.
Thank you very much, Jam ban Chofi.
Nabulungi.
Nam ban Chofi.
Ah, I'm sorry.
We, we really appreciate your help, Nabulungi.
Oh hey, hey...
Um, heh, um, um, look, maybe, maybe sometime Elder Cunningham and I could, could talk to you, maybe tell you a little bit about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?
I, I have to get back to my village, but I am always there if you would like to talk.
Just, just one piece of advice:
No matter how hot you get at night, keep your windows closed.
It is the only way to protect against the scorpions.
And the mosquitoes.
And the lions.
And the murderers and the robbers, and the AIDS, and the snakes, and the safari ants, which can actually plant their eggs underneath your skin and eat you from the inside out.
Man elder, can you believe this?
I know, she is such a hot shade of black, right?
She's like, she's like a latte.
Let's go inside and meet the other elders, alright?
Hello?
The new recruits are here!
Welcome Elder Price and Elder Cunningham.
I am Elder McKinley, current district leader for this area of the Uganda mission.
Nice to meet you. And my name is Elder Church, originally from the great city of Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Elder Michaels from Provo.
Elder Thomas, but the elders here all call me Elder Pop-Tart, 'cause I love them so much.
And over there are Elder Neeley and Elder Davis.
Whoa, that's a lot to remember.
Let's sit, let's sit.
Well, we've all been together about three months now, spreading the Word of Christ, saving the souls of the fine Ugandan people through baptism.
Well uh, how many have you baptized so far?
Uh... zero.
That's practically nothing.
Zero, yes, but there's always hope that tomorrow will be different.
Right!
Because tomorrow is a Latter Day!
Hey, are you alright, partner?
Yeah.
I'm just getting a little confused... right now, so.
Oh, confused.
Well elder, that is natural.
There are certainly a lot of things here in Uganda that can be... disturbing.
But your mission has officially started.
Which means you have to do what we have all done.
I got a feelin' That you could be feelin' A whole lot better than you feel today
You say you got a problem?
Well that's no problem
It's super-easy not to feel that way
When you start to get confused Because of thoughts in your head
Don't feel those feelings
Hold them in instead
Turn it off
Like a light switch Just go click
It's a cool little Mormon trick We do it all the time
When you're feelin' certain feelings that just don't seem right Treat those pesky feelings like a reading light
And turn them off Like a light switch
Just go bap Really, what's so hard about that?
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Okay When I was young my dad Would treat my mom real bad
Every time the Utah Jazz would lose
He'd start a-drinkin' And I'd start a-thinkin'
"How am I gonna keep my Mom from getting abused?"
I'd see her all scared And my soul was dyin'
My dad would say to me "now don't you dare start cryin'!"
Turn it off Like a light switch Just go click
It's our nifty little Mormon trick
Turn it off!
Turn. It.
My sister was a dancer But she got cancer
The doctor said she still had two months more
I thought she had time So I got in line For the new iPhone at the Apple Store
She lay there dying with my father and mother
Her very last words were "Where is my brother?"
Turn it off!
Bid those sad feelings adieu
The fear that I might get cancer too...
When I was in fifth grade I had a friend, Steve Glade
He and I were close as two friends could be
One thing led to another, and soon I would discover
(Wow! ) I was having really strange feelings for Steve...
I thought about us On a deserted island (We're all alone...)
We'd swim naked in the sea, and then he'd try and...
Woah!
Turn it off!
Like a light switch
There it's gone!
(Good for you!
) My hetero side just won!
I'm all better now
Boys should be with girls, That's Heavenly Father's plan
So if you ever feel you'd rather be with a man
Turn it off!
Well, Elder McKinley, I think it's okay that you're having gay thoughts. Just so long as you never act upon them.
No, 'cause then you're just keepin' it down
Like a dimmer switch on low... (On low...)
Thinking nobody needs to know (Uh oh...)
But that's not true!
Being gay is bad, But lying is worse
So just realize you have a curable curse, And turn it off!
(Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Now, how do you feel?
The same.
Then you've only got yourself to blame
You didn't pretend hard enough
Imagine that your brain is made of tiny boxes Then find the box that's gay and CRUSH IT!
Okay?
No, no.
I'm not having gay thoughts.
Alright! It worked!
Yay! He turned it ooooff!
(Turned it off! ) Turn it off!
Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!
Like a light switch Just go 'click'!
(Click click!
) What a cool little Mormon trick (Trick trick!
) We do it all the time!
When you're feelin' certain feelings that just don't seem right (don't seem right) Treat those pesky feelings like a reading light
And turn it off!
Like a light switch on a cord And now he isn't gay any
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it...
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it... Turn it...
Turn it off!
Alright elders, alright. Our two new missionaries must be exhausted from all their travels.
Let's show them their room so they can unpack.
A six, seven, eight.
Tada. All right!
Check it out! We get to sleep right next to each other!
Alright elders, get settled in.
Now, according to missionary rules, lights out promptly at 10, and we all wake up at exactly 6:30.
I've heard a lot of great things about you, Elder Price.
I'm really hopin' you can... turn things around here.
Hoho, don't worry. We will.
Elders, we're glad you're here.
Heavenly Father, as we prepare to turn in for the night, we ask that you give us the...
the strength to spread your wisdom and also, and also the knowledge-
Do you think Frodo was really the hero of The Lord of the Rings?
Sometimes I think it was actually Samwise that did everything.
What?
I mean think about it:
Who got the ring back from Gollum?
Hm?
OH!
Samwise.
And who pulled Frodo up the side of the mountain? Just think about however to- I remember now!
Samwise Gamgee did it!
Okay um, uh, Elder,
I - Maybe we should have some companionship evaluation time.
Oh, yeah!
Uh, you clearly... have a great passion for uh... for, for things.
And, and and you like to talk about... stuff?
Um, I was wondering if maybe uh, the things and stuff you seem to be focusing on are the things and stuff that apply to the reason we are here.
Can you do that for me?
I'd do anything for you!
I'm your best friend.
Well, all right...
Let's get some sleep, huh?
Sleep now, little buddy, Put your cares aside
Nappy with a happy face, I am by your side
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to make you feel better.
I feel fine.
But this is what I'm talking about.
Your focus needs to be on our work.
Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be?
The missionaries here have yet to baptize a single person.
Well, if they had already baptized a bunch of people here, then it wouldn't be so incredible when you did it, now would it?
I guess.
I guess that's sort of true...
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna let you down.
Today we're gonna bring lots of Africans to the church.
I just know it.
You know what, Elder?
Really?
Yeah.
Evening star shines brightly, God makes life anew!
Sleep now, tighty night!
And I am here for you.
I am here for you, too.
We are here, for us.
Goodnight, best friend!
Nabulungi!
Where have you been?
! Baba, look what I found in the market!
What have I told you about wandering off? !
The market is not safe!
But Baba, I finally found one.
A texting device.
Now I can text all of my friends.
Listen to me woman!
Do not go to the market again!
The general is mutilating girls in the next village over!
Baba I'm sorry.
Nabulungi, we must be careful.
If we want to stay alive, our village needs to lay low and not attract any attention.
City lights here we go from northern ligh...
Let's go out and get some placements!
Right!
Uh, what's a placement again?
A placement is getting somebody to take a Book of Mormon.
If you give one out, that counts as a placement.
Remember?
Right, I knew that...
Look, maybe you should just let me do the talking and you can sort of support what I'm saying by going "oh wow" and stuff like that.
Yeah!
Yeah, like one of those infomercials.
You know how they have, how they always have some guy trying to sell something and then, there's always some lady standing next to them saying "Oh wow, what an incredible offer!"
I'm, I'm like that lady!
Okay.
Yeah!
Okay, whatever.
Uh, what do you say we just start with this little house, huh?
We just walk up like we're at the missionary training center.
Okay!
- Okay!
There's no doorbell!
There isn't any doorbell!
What do you want?
!
Oh...
Hello ma'am, do you ever feel like there's something missing from your life?
Um, when you go to sleep at night, do you sometimes feel a power stirring inside you?
Yes.
That's how I feel.
You sir!
Come on down here, huh?
Do you find yourself asking questions about this feeling?
Yes.
And it's because... you want to believe in something else, isn't it?
No, it's because I have maggots in my scrotum.
You've got what?
! I have maggots in my scrotum.
Can you tell?
Well, uh, you, you should probably see the doctor.
I am the doctor.
Just calm down, calm down!
Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to tell you all about a very special book.
Eh, what kind of book?
Well, this book tells you how to find Paradise... through Christ.
They've heard of the Bible.
We all have.
Banbanchelfi.
People come and tell us about Jesus and him dying for our sins once a year.
They always come, tell us the story, and leave!
Nothing is better!
Your Bible doesn't work.
Well of course that didn't work.
Those were Christian missionaries.
We're Mormons.
What's the difference?
We've got a little more...
A touch more rock 'n' roll.
And most important, a hip new prophet by the name of Joseph Smith.
Have you heard of the All-American Prophet?
The blond-haired, blue-eyed voice of God?
He didn't come from the Middle East like those other holy men,
The most blessed Prophet was All-American!
I'm gonna take you back to Biblical times. 1823.
An American man named Joe livin' on a farm
In the holy land of upstate New York!
You mean the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith?
That's right!
That young man spoke to God!
He spoke to God?
And God said "Joe, people really need to know that the Bible isn't two parts!
There's a part three to The Bible, Joe!
And I, God, have anointed you to dig up this part three that's buried by a tree on a hill in your backyard!"
Wow!
God says go to your backyard and start digging!
That makes perfect sense!
Joseph Smith went up on that hill and dug where he was told!
And deep in the ground Joseph found shining plates of gold!
What are these golden plates?
Who buried them here and why?
Then appeared an angel:
His name was Moroni!
I... am Moroni.
The All-American angel!
My people lived here long, long ago!
This is a history of my race, please read the words within
We were Jews who met with Christ, but we were All-American!
But don't let anybody see these plates except for you...
They are only for you to see...
Even if people ask you to show the plates to them, don't
Just copy them onto normal paper
Even though this might make them question if the plates are real or not...
This is sort of what God is going for...
Joseph took the plates home and wrote down what he found inside
He turned those plates into a book, Then he rushed into town and cried:
Hey!
God spoke to me and gave me this blessed ancient tome
He has commanded me to publish it And stick it in ev'ry home!
Wow!
So the Bible is actually a trilogy and the Book of Mormon is Return of the Jedi?
I'm interested!
Now many people didn't believe the prophet Joseph Smith.
They thought he made up this part three that was buried by a tree on the hill in his backyard.
Many people even called Joseph Smith a liar.
So Joe said,
This is no lie, I speak to God all the time and he told me to head west!
So I'll take my part three from the hill with the tree
Feel free if you'd like to come along with me to the promised land!
Paradise, on the west coast!
Nothing but fruit and fields as far as the eye can see!
Joe led his followers across the USA
Spreading their new religion to folks along the way
They kept searching for that promised land, no promise there would be.
And as they passed through every town, the Mormons would decree!
Have you heard of the All-American prophet?
He found a brand-new book about Jesus Christ!
We're following him to Paradise, we call ourselves Mormon
And our new religion is All-American!
Wow, this all sounds so incredibly awesome!
The Mormons kept on searching for that place to settle down But every time they thought they found it they got kicked out of town
And even though people wanted to see the golden plates
Joseph never showed 'em!
I have maggots in my scrotum
Um... okay...
Well, anyway...
Now comes the part of our story That gets a little bit sad
On the way to the promised land, Mormons made people mad
Joseph was shot by an angry mob And knew he'd soon be dead
And even as his life drained away, he stood by what he said:
You must now lead the people, my good friend Brigham Young
You're wise and pure of heart, and... all-Ameri... can
Oh God, Why are you letting me die
Without having me show people the plates?
They'll have no proof I was telling the truth or not
They'll have to believe me just... 'cause
I guess that's kinda what you were going for...
The prophet Joseph Smith died for what he believed in.
But his followers, they kept heading west.
And Brigham Young led them to paradise.
A sparkling land in Utah they called Salt Lake City.
And we come from there today to tell you what those early settlers sang long ago!
Have you heard of the All-American Church
Here's a pocket hand-held Bible for you!
It'll all make sense if you read Part 3, so follow those books from the hill with the tree!
And you'll reach the promised land too!
Keep you word and then we'll also throw in a set of steak knives!
All-American!
So?
Who would like their very own copy of the Book of Mormon?
What the fuck is a steak knife?
What the heck were you doing?
Just doing my part, you know, 'cause we're supposed to be a team.
Well... there's nothing in the Book of Mormon about steak knives!
I'm sorry.
I've never actually read it.
You what?
It's... it's just so boring!
How could I even believe that you...?
He's here!
What is this?
Some kind of public assembly?
My name is General Koni, leader of the NRA Rebellion and protector!
Here you don't protect anyone!
We have not signed up for your rebellion!
It is just a gang of thugs who steal and mutilate women for no reason!
For no reason?
The clitoris... is an abomination!
Its voodoo power has brought a wrath upon Uganda and it must be cast out!
My wife's body is none of your business!
And you are no general.
By the end of the week, all females in this village will be circumcised!
Or else...
All right, they're all gone.
You have to stay indoors, Nabulungi!
Keep the lights off, and the windows closed!
But Baba, we have to help and fight him!
We can't fight against this, Nabulungi!
We just have to hope they move on!
- But Baba... they white boys...
- What? They said they know the answers to our problems.
I have to go check on the others!
Listen to me, Baba!
The Mormons talked about people who were miserable like us, but they all found someplace to go.
Somewhere wonderful.
I'm going to text them right now and tell them we are interested.
Put that stupid thing down!
Just stay inside, and do not open the door for anyone!
My mother once told me of a place With waterfalls and unicorns flying Where there was no suffering, no pain Where there was laughter instead of dying
I always thought she'd made it up To comfort me in times of pain
But now I know that place is real Now I know its name
Sal Tlay Ka Siti Not just a story mama told
But a village in Ootah Where the roofs are thatched with gold
If I could let myself believe I know just where I'd be
Right on the next bus to paradise:
I can imagine what it must be like This perfect, happy place
I'll bet the goat meat there is plentiful,
And they have vitamin injections by the case
The warlords there are friendly They help you cross the street
And there's a Red Cross on every corner
With all the flour you can eat!
Sal Tlay Ka Siti The most perfect place on Earth
Where flies don't bite your eyeballs And human life has worth
It isn't a place of fairy tales It's as real as it can be
A land where evil doesn't exist Sal Tlay Ka Siti
And I'll bet the weather is nice there
And I'm sure the streets are clean
And I hope that when I get there I'll be able to fit in...
Will I fit in?
Sal Tlay Ka Siti A land of hope and joy
And if I want to get there I just have to follow that white boy
You were right, mama, you didn't lie The place is real, and I'm gonna fly!
I'm on my way
Soon life won't be so... shitty
Now salvation has a name
Sal Tlay Ka Siti
O. M. Gosh you guys, I am freaking out!
What is it?
I just got off the phone with the zone leader.
The mission president wants a written progress report from us this week!
A progress report?
But we don't have any baptisms.
I know that!
What are we gonna do? !
Okay okay okay! Hold on!
I mean, maybe we should just... say... we had some baptisms.
What? You mean, lie?
Well...
Are you an idiot?
! Mormons don't lie!
I once told a lie when I was 12 and I had a dream that I went to Hell!
It was really spooky.
You did?
I got the worst hell dreams after the day that my sister died.
You guys have the hell dreams too?
Look, we've all had the Spooky Hell Dream, people.
I have it nightly.
The issue now is what the heck am I supposed to tell the Mission President!
Elder Price?
What happened to you? !
Africa... is nothing like The Lion King!
I think that movie took a lot of artistic license!
He's upset because we just saw some guy get shot in the face.
I can't continue my mission in this way!
There's absolutely nothing I can accomplish here!
Elder Price, you cannot lose your cool on me now!
We're about to get evaluated by the Mission President!
The Mission President...
That's it, I need to go talk to the Mission President and get transferred!
Buddy!
Buddy, I know things seem tough right now, but remember, tomorrow is a Latter Day!
Yeah! Latter Day doesn't mean tomorrow!
It means the afterlife!
Latter Day, when good people get to go to Heavenly Father and they get everything they've always wanted!
I'm out of here!
Hey, hey!
Are you forgetting Rule Number 23?
You may not...
leave the living quarters after 9 pm!
To heck with the rules!
I'm not wasting the most important two years of my life!
Hey uh...
Hold up, you forgot me!
Elder Cunningham!
Do you also want to break Rule Number 23?
Oh no!
What am I supposed to do?
According to Rule Number 23, I can't leave the living quarters after curfew!
But according to Rule Number 72 I can't leave my companion alone!
This is like a Matrix logic trick!
Rule 23, Rule 72, Rule 23...
I CAN'T SEE!
It's been a thing since I was a kid.
I'm sorry guys, he's my best friend!
Hey, come on! We're supposed to be together at all times!
I can't do something incredible here!
Okay!
Stop, breathe, think!
This isn't what you want to do.
Yes it is!
Okay!
Uhhh, right.
If that's what you want to do, then that's what we're doin'.
We're transferring.
I'm with you- I didn't say we're transferring!
I said I am.
Oh I see...
Look, you and me, we're s- not that compatible, alright?
Well we only became best friends a few days ago.
May- And I'm not your best friend!
I just got stuck with you by the missionary training center!
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to say "stuck"...
It's just that-
Eh, yeah, yeah, it's fine.
It's, it's alright.
I know how it goes.
It's really fine.
I'll be, I'll be totally fine.
Yes! Yes, you will be fine. It's just that we...
need um... different things.
- Right.
Right, just... different things is all.
It was really nice meeting you.
Yeah...
You too.
Take it easy.
Evening star shines brightly God makes life anew
Sleep now, tighty night I was there for you
There you are!
Thank goodness I found you.
Where is your friend?
Uh, I don't have any friends.
No!
I have written Elder Price a text.
Here.
It says to please come back to the village.
We are ready.
To do what?
To listen to him.
I texted everyone that we have to give Elder Price a chance.
Well I'm sorry, he's requested a transfer.
What is a transfer?
That means he'll be sent somewhere else.
No, he can't leave.
We are ready to listen.
It's too late.
He's already made up his mind.
What about you?
Me?
What?
He is gone, but you are still here.
You will lead us!
Teach us everything about what is in the Book of Mormon!
Me?
Nooo!
Noohoho!
I'm a follower.
Everyone's waiting.
Come back to the village and you will have your listeners.
I swear it.
What did Jesus do When they sentenced him to die?
Did he try to run away?
Did he just break down and cry?
No, Jesus dug down deep, knowing what he had to do
When faced with his own death, Jesus knew that he had to...
Man up He had to man up
So he crawled up on that cross, and he stuck it out
And he manned up Christ, he manned up
And taught us all what real manning up is about
And now it's up to me, and it's time to man up
Jesus had his time to, now it's mine to man up
I'm taking the reins, I'm crossing the bear
And just like Jesus, I'm growing a pair!
I've gotta stand up, can't just clam up
It's time to man up!
'Cause there's a time in your life when you know you've got to man up
Don't let it pass you by There's just one time to man up
Watch me man up like nobody else!
I'm gonna man up all over myself!
I've got to get ready It's time to, time to...
What did Jesus do when they put nails through his hands?
Did he scream like a girl, or did he take it like a man?
When someone had to die to save us from our sins,
Jesus said, "I'll do it," and he took it on the chin!
He manned up, and manned up
He took a bullet for me and you That's man up, real man up
And now it's my time to do it too!
Time to be a hero and slay the monster!
Time to battle darkness You're not my father!
I'm gonna time to, just watch me go!
Time to stand up and steal the show!
Time to, time to, time to, time to, time to...
Sal Tlay Ka Siti, a place of hope and joy
To man up!
And if we want to go there, we just have to follow that white boy
Time to!
Heavenly Father, why do you let bad things happen?
- Ka-lay-ka Siti!
- Did you get my text?
I can't believe all the terrible things you let happen!
Ka-lay-ka Siti, we got your text!
I don't belong in a place like this!
(Man up! )
Take me back to where things make sense! A place I know where God exists:
Orlando!
Orlando!
We will listen to the fat white guy!
My time to, time to Now it's my time to, time to!
But Hasa Diga Eebowai!
No time to, not time to Now it's time to, time to!
I'm in the lead for the very first time!
I'm home with the people to show me ta-
Mine to! I've got to stand up, get my flippin' can up
It's time to, time to!
Man up!
Sal Tlay Ka Siti
Sal Tlay Ka Siti Sal Tlay... It is time to...
I have maggots in my scrotum!
Indeed, it came to pass that the prophet Joseph Smith discovered the Book of Mormon on golden plates.
But what exactly is the Book of Mormon about?
It tells of two Hebrew tribes that walked in ancient America.
The gentle Nephites, and the wicked Lamanites.
They fought many great battles, but then, just after his crucifixion, Christ appeared.
I... am Jesus.
I've just been crucified on the other side of the world.
I only have three days before I am resurrected, but in that time I will preach here to you in America.
And lo, Christ spoke of many things, and the Nephites came forth and wrote the teachings on plates of gold.
Plates that became the Book of Mormon, a book that is still today read by missionaries all over the world!
And it came to pass that the Nephites did gather together a great number of men, even to exceed the number of 30,000.
Uh...
And it came to pass that, in the same year, they had a number of battles in which the Nephites did beat the Lamanites and did slay many of them.
And what the fuck does that mean?
It means, you know, you should be nice to each other, or s- or something.
The LORD was so displeased with the Lamanites that he caused a cursing to come upon them.
And wherefore as they were white and delightsome, the LORD God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them, and God said-
Nev- mi-, never mind, let's, let's forget that part.
How is this supposed to make things better for us?
The general is going to come back, and if he sees us here, we are all dead!
Baba, please!
We just need to listen.
To what?
!
Three hours we've been listening to him talk about stupid shit that happened on the other side of the Earth thousands of years ago!
It has nothing to do with us.
Yeah! And those Nephites probably didn't even have AIDS to deal with!
! Sure they did!
Sure they did!
Back then people had even worse AIDS!
Yeah!
And lo, the LORD said unto the Nephites:
"I know you're really depressed, what with all your AIDS, and everything, but there's an answer in Christ."
You see?
This book can help us.
I just told a lie...
No wait, I didn't lie,
I just used my imagination
And it worked!
You're making things up again, Arnold
But it worked, Dad!
You're stretching the truth again and you know it
Don't be a fibbing Fran, Arnold
Joseph Smith?
Because a lie is a lie
It's not a lie!
You're making things up again, Arnold
Oh conscience!
You're taking the Holy Word and adding fiction
Be careful how you proceed, Arnold
When you fib, there's a price
Ah, this is bullshit!
The story that I have been told is that the way to cure AIDS is by sleeping with a virgin!
Ah, I'm going to go and rape a baby.
WHAT?
OH MY, NO!
YOU CAN'T DO THAT! NO!
Why not? !
Because that is definitely against God's will!
Says who?
Where in that book of yours does it say anything about sleeping with a baby? !
Nowhere!
Uh, behold!
The LORD said to the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith,
"You shall NOT have sex with that infant!"
And lo Joseph said, "Why not, LORD?
Huh? Why not?"
And the LORD said,
"if you lay with that infant, you shall... burn in the fiery pits of...
Really?
Uh huh...
Uh huh.
"A baby cannot cure your illness, Joseph Smith.
I shall give unto you a... a FROG." And thus, Joseph laid with the frog, and his AIDS was no more!
You're making things up again, Arnold
You're recklessly morphing the words of Jesus
You can't just say what you want, Arnold
Come on, Hobbits!
You're digging yourself a deep hole
I'm making things up again, kind of,
But this time it's helping a dozen people
It's nothing so bad, because this time I'm not committing a sin just by making things up again!
- Right? - No!
Elder Cunningham, you have to stop him!
What?
What is it?
Gotswana is going to cut off his daughter's clitoris.
Huh?
This is all very interesting, but the general said that it is because our women aren't circumcised that God has brought this wrath upon us!
No, doing that to a lady is definitely against Christ's will!
How do you know? !
Christ never said nothin' 'bout no clitoris!
YES!
YES HE DI-ID!
In ancient New York three men were about to cut off a Mormon woman's cli- toris.
But, right before they did, Jesus had... Boba Fett turn them into frogs!
Frogs?
You mean like the frog that got fucked by Joseph Smith?
Riiight.
Riiiight, like those frogs.
For "a clitoris is holy amongst all things," said He.
You're making things up again, Arnold (We're learning the truth)
You're taking the Holy Word and adding fiction (The truth about God!
Be careful how you proceed, Arnold (We're going to Paradise!
) When you fib, there's a price
Who would have thought I'd have this magic touch?
Who'd have believed I could man up this much?
I'm talkin', they're listenin', My stories are glistening',
I'm gonna save them all with this stuff!
You're making things up again, Arnold. (Elder Cunningham!
You're making things up again, Arnold. (Holy prophet man!
) You're making things up again, Arnold. (Our savior!
)
You're making things up again...
Hmm, up again making things you are
Arnold...
I'm here!
This is it!
I'm here!
Ah!
It's even better than I could've imagined!
The streets are clean, the people are happy...
Epcot Center.
I can see the ball!
The funny thing is, I don't really remember getting here.
Wait, this can't be Orlando.
I don't even remember the plane landing.
What's happening to me?
Elder Price!
Who is that?
! You broke the rules, Elder!
Your soul belongs to me now!
Mickey?
You now dwell in eternal flame!
I remember this place!
Long ago when I was five
I snuck in the kitchen late at night And ate a doughnut with a maple glaze
My father asked who ate the snack I said that it was my brother Jack
And Jack got grounded for fourteen days
I've lived with that guilt all of my life And the terrible vision that I had that night
No, please!
I don't wanna go back!
Down, down thy soul is cast!
From the Earth whence forth ye fell!
The path of fire leads thee To Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Welcome back to Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
You are having A Spooky Mormon Hell Dream now!
And now I've gone and done it again (Rectus!
I committed another awful sin (Dominus!
) I left my mission companion all alone (Spookytus!
)
Oh God, how could I have done this to you?
(Deus! )
How could I break Rule 72? (Creepyus!
)
And now my soul hath just been thrown Back into Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Down, down to Satan's realm See where you belong!
There is nothing you can do
No escape from Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
You blamed your brother for eating the doughnut, and now you walk out on your mission companion?
You're a dick!
Jesus, I'm sorry!
Jesus hates you, this we know!
For Jesus just told you so!
You remember Lucifer? !
He is even spookier!
Bring him to meeee!
Minions of Hades, have you heard the news?
Kevin was caught playing hooky!
Now he's back with all you Cath'lics and Jews!
It's super spooky-wooky!
I'm sorry, Lord, it was selfish of me To break the rules, please I don't wanna be
In this Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Genghis Khan, Jeffrey Dahmer, Hitler, Johnnie Cochran
Their spirits all surround you!
Spooky, spooky, spoooo-ky!
I started a war und killed millions of Jews!
I slaughtered the Chinese!
I stabbed a guy and fucked his corpse!
I got OJ free!
You think that's bad?
I broke Rule 72!
I left my companion and I'm way worse than you!
I hate this Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Oh, Heavenly Father!
Please give me one more chance!
I won't break the rules again!
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream Spooky Mormon Hell Dream
Dad!
I can't believe Jesus called me a dick!
Welcome, welcome to Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
You are never waking up from Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Oh, please help me Father! (Down, down thy soul is cast) Please let me wake up!
Give me one more chance!
I won't let you down again! (In Spooky Mormon Hell Dream! )
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream now!
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream done!
Come on, Elder Price. Wake up, buddy.
Wait, what? ! Where am I?
It looks like you passed out at the bus station.
We were so worried!
Oh I'm, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I had a little, uh meltdown, last night.
But I'm not leaving.
Oh, good, good.
That I was wrong, and I'm gonna stay here and stick to my work!
Oh.
You had the Hell dream, didn't you?
Was I in it?
Oh, hey guys.
Elder Cunningham, where on Heavenly Father's green Earth have you been?
Oh, nowhere much, just with ten eager Africans who are now interested in the Church!
Yes, yep, they're completely into the teachings and ready to learn more.
Are you serious, Elder Cunningham?
That's amazing!
Oh, Elder Price.
Hey.
So, did you find yourself a new... companion?
No.
No, I didn't. And I'm sorry about that.
But this is great, Elder Cunningham.
If you've got some eager followers, we could really turn things around here!
I think we should start... preparing which verses we're going to teach them, maybe maybe prep some exercises, or find some, some music, maybe then-
WOOAAHHH!
WOH-HOOAAAHHH!
You left me!
Remember?
Yes, I know.
And I'm sorry.
But Heavenly Father has shown me I need to stay here!
So now what?
I'm just supposed to take you back?
Elder Cunningham.
We must all work in pairs. Remember?
Give Elder Cunningham a break!
If it's working better this way, then, leave Elder Price out of it.
Now, how many of the people want to have follow-up sessions?
Oh um, let's see, all of them!
Do you think we might actually get a baptism out of this?
They always say you just have to get that first baptism and the others will follow!
Hold up!
I know I'm doing a really good job and all, but let's not get too carried away, I mean, a lot of the people here are so scared to death of that General Koni guy.
It's true.
Everywhere we go, people keep talking about General Koni, and how he'll kill them.
Sometime I'd like to convince that general that what he's doing is wrong.
Well no one is going to change how a warlord thinks.
That would take something...
Something incredible Something incredible
Look, let's just be happy that Elder Cunningham has the people interested.
It's okay you guys!
I've got everything under control!
I know what Heavenly Father wants for me now.
This whole country is gonna be SAVED!
Ever since I was a child I tried to be the best
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed
So what happened?
It was supposed to be all so exciting
To be teaching of Christ 'cross the sea
But I allowed my faith to be shaken Oh, what's the matter with me?
I've always longed to help the needy
To do the things I never dared
This was the time for me to step up So then why was I so scared?
A warlord who shoots people in the face
What's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier
And always has my back
Now I must be completely devout
I can't have even one shred of doubt!
I believe that the Lord God created the universe
I believe that he sent his only son to die for my sins
And I believe that ancient Jews built boats and sailed to America
I am a Mormon And a Mormon just believes
You cannot just believe partway You have to believe in it all
My problem was doubting the Lord's work, instead of standing tall
I can't allow myself to have any doubt
It's time to set my worries free
Time to show the world what Elder Price is about
And while I show them, I'll show me!
I believe that God has a plan for all of us
I believe that plan involves me getting my own planet
And I believe that the current President of the Church, Thomas Monson, speaks directly to God!
I am a Mormon, and dang it, A Mormon just believes!
I know that I must go And do the things my God commands
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith He will always answer you
Just believe in him and have no fear
General!
We have an intruder!
He just walked right into camp!
I believe that Satan has a hold of you
I believe that the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people!
You can be a Mormon A Mormon who just believes
What the fuck is this?
! And now I can feel the excitement
This is the moment I was born to do
And I feel so incredible To be sharing my faith with you
The Scriptures say that if you ask in faith If you ask God himself, you'll know
But you must ask him without any doubt
And let your spirit grow!
I believe that God lives on a planet called Kolob
I believe that Jesus has his own planet as well
And I believe that the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri
If you believe, the Lord will reveal it And you'll know it's all true You'll just feel it
You'll be a Mormon!
And, by gosh, a Mormon just believes!
Oh, I believe!
So,
Jumamosi!
Wait!
God has spoken to me, sir!
By the power of God Almighty touch me NOT!
Uh, the power of Christ compels you!
Wait, what are you doing?
Let me go!
Right, right.
So Christ said, "You've gotta be strong, you know?
Just because the Lamanites have big Death Star weapons and stuff, doesn't mean you should let them run your lives, you know?
There's more of you than there are of them; you've gotta stand up for yourselves!" Christ said.
Oh!
Just like the way the Hobbits all stood up against Brigham Young's killers!
Very good, Middala.
So, the Nephites...
fought off the wicked Lamanites, and for punishment the Lord God turned the Lamanites... yellow!
Oh!
Like the Chinese!
Right, right.
Oh-kay we should probably stop there for today.
Hopeful we'll see everyone again tomorrow?
The book is right: we must not fight amongst each other.
I love all these Mormon stories!
They are so fucking weird and interesting!
Elder Cunningham, I just wanted to say, we are very happy Heavenly Father brought you here.
Oh, thank you.
I have never seen the people here so happy.
Even Baba.
You... are amazing.
Oh. Well, I haven't really done that much.
But you have.
I texted my friend the story of Joseph Smith's battle with diarrhea, and he said everyone in his village has read it.
You are a great man.
Thank you.
I kind of am, huh?
All the Mormons are such amazing people.
They traveled across the United States to find Paradise in Sal Tlay Ka Siti.
And even though they found it, they still travel the world to show others the way.
I guess I never really thought of it like that.
Do you think that we are worthy enough to join you?
We have been trying very hard. And we are ready to do whatever tasks you require of us.
Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. There's nothing they have to do to become Mormon.
We let anybody who wants to join up, so long as they're willing to commit to the Church.
Well then, would you like to baptize me?
Shh yeah, sure, that would be... great.
Okay!
Let's do it!
What? Now?
Why not?
Well... to be honest, I've never done it before.
That's okay.
Neither have I!
Do you know how to baptize someone into the Church?
Sssure, that's something we studied over and over again at...
Mission Control Center.
Please, Elder Cunningham, I want to be baptized.
I swear to dedicate my life to the Church.
Hah, okay, I, uh, just need a second to get ready.
Okay!
I'll go get ready too.
I'm about to do it for the first time
And I'm gonna do it with a girl!
A special girl Who makes my heart kinda flutter Makes my eyes kinda blur
I can't believe I'm about to baptize her
He will baptize me He will hold me in his arms
And he will baptize me Right in front of everyone
And it will set me free When he looks into my eyes And he sees just how much I love being baptized
I'm gonna baptize her Bathe her in God's glory
And I will baptize her With everything I got
And I'll make her beg for more As I wash her free of sin
And it'll be so good She'll want me to baptize her again
Excuse me, I, I need another minute!
Never known a boy so gentle One like him is hard to find A special kind
He makes my heart kind of flutter Like a moth in a cocoon
I hope he gets to baptizing me soon!
I'm gonna baptize you!
I'm through with all my stallin'
You're gonna baptize me!
I'm ready to let you do it
And it will set us free It's time to be immersed
And I'm so happy you're about to be my first!
Are you ready?
I am ready.
So how do we do it?
Well, I hold you like this.
Yeah?
Then I lower you down.
Yeah?
And then I...
I just baptized her!
She got dowsed by Heavenly Father
I just baptized her good!
I performed like a champ!
I'm wet with salvation!
We just went all the way!
Praise be to God!
I'll never forget this day
I baptized you!
I gotcha good
You wanted it more, baby!
I'll text you later.
"Dear Mission President, it is my honor to inform you that the elders of Uganda District 9 have brought twenty new members into the Church.
They are all fully commited to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and our numbers continue to grow."
This is outstanding.
These boys have converted more Africans than any district in the country.
Elders of District 9, you have truly honored the Church by your success.
Congratulations on becoming one...
I am Africa I am Africa
With the strength of the cheetah My native voice shall ring
We are Africa We are the heartbeat of Africa

The noble Lion King
We are Africa
We are the winds of the Serengeti
We are the sweat of the jungle man
We are the tears of Nelson Mandela
We are the lost boys of the Sudan!
I am Africa
Just like Bono, I am Africa
I flew in here and became one with this land
I'm not a follower anymore No, now I am Africa!
With my Zulu spear I run barefoot through the sand
And I am Africa!
Something incredible You've done something incredible
I have never seen a rectal blockage of this kind
I have seen patients in the past With rodents or bottles in their ass
But this is something incredible And it blows my freakin' mind!
We are the snows of Kilimanjaro We are gorillas in the mist
We are the galleys of the Amistad We are Fela's defiant fist!
We are Africa
Oh Neosporin it's amazing!
The mission president wants to meet me personally and he's gonna give me a medal!
Oh elder, that is incredible!
We are Africa The zebra and giraffica
Are you telling me that an entire village is wearing white and dunking themselves into water? !
Well what type of... voodoo magic is that? !
It freaks me out! They must all be put to death!
We are the Africa The one and only Africa
And the life we live Is primitive and proud!
We are Africa We are deepest, darkest Africa!
We are the fields and fertile forest, well endowed
We are Africa

A tribal woman who doesn't wear a bra
Africans are African But we are Africa!
Hit me!
Gimme another one!
Come ON!
Thank you.
You wanna hear something funny?
I used to think drinking coffee was wrong.
You wanna know why?
Because apparently, a tribe of ancient Jews lived in America, created huge civilizations and were visited by Christ, but then, then disappeared, leaving no archaeological trace of themselves except... for golden plates, which were then dug up by a farmer who wrote down,
amongst other things, that hot drinks were not for the body to belly, so I can't have a cup of coffee!
Elder Price?
Are you okay?
Well well!
If it isn't the super Mormon!
Really changed in Uganda, aren'tcha?
I'm doin' what I can.
Yeah?
Spreadin' the Word? Makin' more brainwashed zombies?
Elder Price? What happened to you?
I woke up.
That's what happened.
Of course you woke up! You drank twelve cups of coffee!
You tell me how it is, huh?
How is it you converted all those people into Mormons? !
I don't know.
Once I baptized Nagasaki the others just fell into place.
You baptized that girl?
Yeah, I did.
Don't hate on me, elder!
You get everything you pray for!
You're doing everything I was supposed to do! Doesn't that seem a little telling to you? !
Well of what?
That the universe doesn't work the way we were told!
When I was nine years old, my family took a trip.
And it was the most... wonderful, most magical place I'd ever seen.
And I decided right then and there,
"This... is where I want to spend eternity."
My parents said that if I made God proud and I did everything the Church asked, in the latter days, I could have whatever
So I worked.
And I worked.
And even when I studied Mormon stories and I thought,
"That doesn't really make sense," I kept working!
Because I was told that one day I would get my reward!
PLANET ORLANDO!
But what do I have now?
Um...
Yeah...
Okay, anyway, so, the uh, the mission president is coming tomorrow and, I'm without my companion and, well, it just looks kind of bad-
Aaaa-oh, so thaaat's why you came!
Noo, I came because I care about you-
BULL POOP!
That is bull poop, elder!
And you know it!
Look, I know we may not be the best "companions,"
but if we can please just ACT like we're still together, in front of the mission president, it would be the best thing for the both of us.
Fine!
But don't talk to me!
And don't touch me!
- Fine!
- Fine!
Orlando Orlando
I liked you, Orlando
Your bright lights Your big dreams
Your promises you couldn't keep
Orlando Orlando
Without you, Orlando
I'm just a guy who will die And never go back... to... you...
You have all done the most amazing work on your missions.
You are the gleaming examples of Latter-Day Saints.
Praise Christ.
Praise Christ.
And you two, Elder Price and Elder Cunningham, you are the most successful missionaries in all of Africa.
Ohh, thank you sir.
My companion has been so very helpful and there for me.
Praise Christ.
Excuse me!
Excuse me mister Mormon President?
My people wish to give you a special welcome.
Neutrogena, what are you doing here?
We, we have learned so much from Elder Cunningham, and as our gift to you we wish to present the story of Joseph Smith and the first Mormons.
NOOOOOOOO!
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I think this is a very bad idea. Let's not do this.
No no no, elder, this is just the sort of thing the Mormon leaders need to be seeing.
Yes, yes yes, let's see what these noble Africans have learned.
And now we wish to honor you with the story of Joseph Smith, the American Moses.
Well, this is very good;
Mormon
I'm going to take you back in time, (Mormon) to the United States, 1823.
(Mormon)
A small and odd village called Upstate New York.
(Upstate)
There was disease and famine, (so sick) but also in this village lived a simple farmer who would change everything.
His name... was Joseph Smith.
Joseph Smith, American Moses
Praise be to Joseph, American prophet man
Aye my name is Joseph Smith, and I am going to fuck this baby.
What! ?
No no Joseph, don't fuck the baby Joseph Smith, don't fuck the baby
Then God came down from heaven and appeared before Joseph Smith.
Joseph Smith, do not fuck a baby
I will get rid of your AIDS If you fuck this frog
Joseph Smith fucked the frog God gave him, and his AIDS went away!
Then a great wizard named Moroni came down from the Starship Enterprise.
Joseph Smith, your village is shit.
You shall lead the villagers to a new village.
Here are the fucking directions.
And on the plates were written the directions to a new land.
Sal Tlay Ka Siti (Sal Tlay Ka Siti)
Joseph tried to convince all the villagers to follow him and his golden plates.
Liberation, equality, no more slavery for Upstate Mormon people!
I got de golden plates (gold plates)
I'm gonna lead the people (we head West)
We gotta stick together (Mormons)
We gotta help each other (we're Mormons)
And so we climb the mountain (we head West)
And we cross the river (we head West)
And we fight the oppression (Mormons)
By being nice to everyone (we are Mormons)
Not so fast Mormons, you shall not pass my mountain!
Down from the mountain look who comes: the American warlord Brigham Young!
Yeees.
I am Brigham Young.
I cut off my daughter's clitoris;
that made God angry, so he turned my nose into a clit for punishment.
Brigham Young, his nose was a clitoris
What will you do Joseph, will you fight the clitoris man?
Not fight him, help him.
Joseph Smith took his magical fuck frog and rubbed it upon Brigham Young's clit face.
And behold Brigham was cured!
Joseph Smith, magical AIDS frog
Brigham Young, frog on his clit face
Brigham Young was so grateful, he decided to join the Mormons on their journey.
Compassion, courtesy, unrelenting politeness from Upstate Mormon People!
I got de golden plates (gold plates)
I'm gonna lead the people (we head West)
We gotta stick together (Mormons)
Now comes the part of our story that gets a little bit sad.
After traveling for so long, the Mormons ran out of fresh water, and become sick... with dysentery.
Mormon go to the water, water go to the cup
Cup go to the stomach, shit come out the butt
Shit go in the water, water go in the cup
Shit go down the stomach, shit come out the butt
Ugh, oh fuck!
Oh no, the prophet Joseph Smith is now getting sick!
Shit go in the water, water go in the cup
Cup go to the thirsty, shit go to the stomach
Blood come out the butt, blood go in the water
Water go in the cup, cup go to the tongue
Shit blood in the stomach, shit blood in the mouth
Shit blood on the insides, water come out the butt
Brigham Young, you take the golden plates and lead the Mormons to the Promised Laaaand!
Desperation, mortality, perseverance!
I...
I'm got to lead the people (we head West)
We gotta stick together...
Even though their prophet had died, the Mormons stuck together and helped each other, and were really nice to everyone they came across.
And then, finally, one day the Mormons found
Sal Tlay Ka Siti.
(Sal Tlay Ka Siti)
And there, the Mormons danced with Ewoks and Jesus.
Welcome Mormons!
Now, let's all have as many babies as we can and make big Mormon families!
Fuck your woman, fuck your man, this is all part of God's plan
Mormons fuck all that they can We're in Salt Lake City land
Thank you, thank you, God
Now we are fucking
Thank you, thank you, God
God wants us fucking
Thank you, thank you, God
Get back to fucking
Thank you, thank you, God
Joseph Smith, fuck frog Brigham Young, clit face
Shit come out the butt
Jesus says:
fuck, fuck Mormons!
Elders!
I'd like to have a word with you...
I think they liked it.
We are sorry, Mission President, we had no idea...
You keep your mouth shut!
You're in enough trouble as it is!
S-sir, um, I was... just trying to help the villagers here.
See, they all really wanted to learn.
Elder! Elder, I wanted to give you this.
It's the entire play written in text.
What is going on?
What's going on here is that you have all brought ridicule down onto the Latter-Day Saints.
But we are all Latter-Day Saints now, right?
You and your people are about as far from being Latter-Day Saints as it gets.
YOU ALL!
Elder Cunningham, tell them!
We are ready to go to Sal Tlay Ka Siti.
My things are packed.
I'm so sorry, Nabagamba, but um,
I never meant that you were actually going to Salt Lake City.
But you said that we could find paradise by listening to you.
Well... when we say that, we mean paradise within yourself.
You know, it's sort of like a... like a Jesus thing.
Oh...
I see.
So, when you baptized me, it meant nothing. No, no!
It meant everything!
Uncircumcised women are going to have their families killed!
Where am I supposed to go? !
I don't, um...
I know what you people are now.
You traveled from your sparkling lovely paradise in Ootah to tell ridiculous stories to people less fortunate to make fun of them!
No no, it isn't like that...
You have crushed my soul!
I hope you all had a good laugh.
Elders, you may as well pack all your things.
This district is shut down.
Go home to your parents, and explain to them that you have all...
I really did it this time, huh?
I mean I've, I've always been a screw-up, but this?
The thing is I, I really liked her too, you know?
And in fact, maybe it was like I could almost be a normal person, with a girl who cared about me, who was... hot.
And instead I made those poor Africans put on the biggest abomination in Mormon history.
Joseph Smith dying of dysentery?
Moroni from the Starship Enterprise?
That play was the most... beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Huh?
It's like...
like you were getting a point across using modern things.
And then you tried to...
wait a minute.
You've been trying to teach me something all along, haven't you?
What?
Here I thought I could just fly in here all on my own a-a-and change everything by just sticking to Scripture.
While you were trying to show me that, that Scripture isn't that important!
I was losing my faith, and you went out and did... something incredible!
You did something incredible
For a people who had nowhere else to go
I thought they were unreachable but then they were happy, and hopeful,
and wearing costumes.
It was almost like...
Orlando...
I'm sorry that it took me so long to... realize what you were trying to teach me, Elder.
Oh, no that's, that's okay.
But what about Nathan Lane? !
I mean, I made her believe in a bunch of made-up crap!
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if the stories are true or not!
It doesn't matter now 'cause she's gonna get clit cut off and it's all my fault!
Elder, come on!
There is always hope!
I will help you fix this!
You... would do that for me?
I'd do anything for you.
You're my best friend.
We all need a partner You're the best for me
We both need each other
We're a really awesome team
As long as we're together There's nothing we cannot do
We can make things right again, me and you
But mostly me
So, what did the Mormon President think of our play?
Did Elder Cunningham like it?
He knows we are still in previews, right?
Well, well.
There you are.
There have been rumors that the people of this village are uniting to oppose us.
We have been shown another way.
No.
No, we do not oppose you.
We will do whatever you say.
Nabulungi, what is wrong?
Our prophet has told us to stick together, to fight oppression!
Forget about Elder Cunningham!
You aren't going to see him ever again!
What are you talking about?
Why aren't we?
Because Elder Cunningham... he... he... he was eaten by lions, alright?
ENOUGH!
There is only one law to obey here and that is mine!
We believe in something else!
No, stop it!
All of you!
I told you our prophet is gone.
There is no promised land, and there is no salvation. Oh no!
You cannot talk like that, Nabulungi.
Remember the first teachings of the Mormons:
When Joseph Smith died, they did not give up on their hope.
But it isn't true.
We aren't going to Sal Tlay Ka Siti.
Nabulungi!
Sal Tlay Ka Siti isn't an actual place.
It's an idea.
A metaphor.
All the stories the prophet has told us... are just metaphors.
Yeah.
You don't think a man actually fucked a frog, do you?
That's fucking stupid.
And you all believe this?
Yes.
Hello?
He has risen!
It is a miracle!
Our prophet returns, even from the dead!
There! You see?
!
He must have fucked a frog!
Who has risen from the dead?
He has! He has!
So, so you might as well just, just put down your guns!
Because they will not work against his... voodoo power!
And if you don't get out of this village, right now, he is going to command the angel Moroni, from the Death Star, to unleash the Kraken, which will then... which will then... which will then...
launch Joseph Smith's torpedoes from its mouth of Christ and turn you into a lesbian!
Oh Nala, I am so sorry!
Please, if you just give me a chance? Elder!
Elder, you don't have to say anything.
I understand.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, elders, where do you think you're going?
What do you mean "where are you going"?
We've been shut down.
Yeah, we have to go home.
Who says we have to?
What?
Guys, we wanted to go on a mission so we could spend two years of our life living someplace exciting and helping people, right?
Yeah.
Well, so let's do it!
But the mission president said we're all about as far from Latter-Day Saints as it gets.
Naw, you know what guys?
Fuck. Him.
We are still Latter-Day Saints!
All of us!
Even if we, we change some things, or we break the rules, or we have complete doubt that God exists.
It doesn't change who we are.
Latter-Day doesn't mean afterlife.
It means tomorrow.
I am a Latter-Day Saint I know not what the future holds
There are sure to be times of joy and sorrow
Who cares what happens when we're dead?
We shouldn't think that far ahead
The only Latter Day that matters is tomorrow
Screw the Church! Why don't we stay?
Tomorrow is a Latter Day Tomorrow is a Latter Day!
The skies are clearing And now the sun's coming out
It's a Latter Day tomorrow
Tomorrow is a Latter Day Tomorrow is a Latter Day
We're here for each other every step of the way
And make a Latter Day tomorrow
Americans already found a cure for AIDS But they're saving it for a Latter Day
Tomorrow is a Latter Day
I believe (Tomorrow is a Latter Day)
The skies are clearing and now the sun's coming out
It's a Latter Day tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is a Latter Day
Tomorrow is a Latter Day Tomorrow is a Latter Day
So what will tomorrow bring?
What does the future hold?
I can almost see it now...

The book of Arnold (Arnold...)
Hello!
For thousands of years, we've wondered if we're alone in the cosmos.
Life - is it a one time event... ..or is it something that's occurred lots of times throughout the universe?
And, at this very moment, new discoveries are bringing us closer to the answers.
We are right on the cusp of being able to say life exists somewhere else.
All of our searching is leading to one ultimate goal.. finding intelligent life somewhere in the vastness of the universe.
If we could discover an advanced civilisation, it would be clearly the greatest discovery of humanity, beating out fire.
Get ready, because the known universe is about to take you on a hunt for life out there.
Over the next hour, we'll show you how the hunt for alien life has dramatically changed over the past few decades.
The lessons we're learning at the bottom of our oceans and in Yellowstone's acid pits are giving us dramatic insight into how life came to be on our planet.
And it's helping us understand and imagine how life might emerge on an alien world.
We'll take you on a journey to faraway planets, where amazing creatures may roam the lands.
Creatures that make the wildest science fiction movies look like reality shows.
And, finally, we'll show you how new technologies are being used to search for, and possibly communicate with, advanced alien civilisations.
so is Earth the only planet where life has emerged in this vast cosmos?
Are we alone?
Or are we part of something bigger- a web of life that stretches light years through the universe?
Are we alone?
And it ties into all the big questions:
How did we get here?
Where are we going?
Are we a part of a bigger picture?
But for many years the question was taboo to science.
Before the mid-1 990s, it was considered somewhat embarrassing to even address the question,
because looking for alien life seems a little frighteningly close to science fiction.
For decades, the furthest we got in looking for aliens was imagining them on the silver screen.
MAN: What is your name?
After all, alien life needs a home.
And we hadn't even found a planet outside our own solar system.
scientists, in fact, never talked about planets around other stars.
There was no way to detect them and so it was one of those domains of science that you couldn't answer, and, therefore, you didn't talk about it.
In 1 995, astronomers discovered a planet orbiting a star 50 light years from Earth.
And since then, they've found hundreds more.
For the first time in human history, we realised that our sun, with its eight major planets that go around it, is just one type of a planetary system, one example of billions.
These discoveries are exciting, but don't expect to be contacting extraterrestrial life on these planets any time soon.
While it's been a spectacular ride in the last decade to find these planets, most of them are giant planets.
Most of the worlds we've found are gas giants, which probably couldn't support life.
You can't stand on them.
There's no hard surface.
They're large balls of hydrogen and helium gas, like Jupiter and saturn.
We found a few rocky planets with hard surfaces, but they're many times more massive than Earth and contain the most hostile environments you could ever imagine.
One such planet, Corot 7B, orbits so close to its star that surface temperatures reach as high as 1,600 degrees Celsius.
sunrise here does not bring the sound of birdsong.
Instead, it's an armageddon of volcanic explosions.
Those planets are all going to be so hot, you can't develop something as complex as life.
scientists have gone back to the drawing board looking to find worlds capable of supporting life, small rocky planets like Earth.
We don't know that life has to evolve on the surface of small, rocky planets.
But we know it did once, here on Earth.
And so, it's a reasonable place to start the search.
Earth is important because we know that this little planet had everything needed to create life.
And if a distant world has similar conditions, there's at least a possibility life could emerge there, too.
If you were to give a biologist a piece of paper and say, "Write down on every line something you need for life."
They'll say you need an energy source, you need oxygen, you need water, you need carbon, you need organic compounds, you need amino acids, you need all this stuff.
There's a long list of factors that make our Earth special and perfectly suited for life.
But the most important is its distance from our energy source - the sun.
At 1 49 million kilometres away, the Earth is at just the right place for water to exist as a liquid.
so why is liquid water important?
Imagine a world so much hotter than the Earth that there are no oceans, no liquid water at all on its surface.
such a place would be like a desert.
Without water, there's nothing to let the grains of sand interact.
And in the same way, without water, there's nothing to allow the atoms - the carbon and oxygen and trace elements - to form the molecules that would give rise to the chemistry of life.
On the other hand, on a world much colder than the Earth, water can only exist as ice, and we have another problem.
This frozen block of sand has all of the grains of sand locked together.
They can't move around and interact, just the same way that on a frozen world, the atoms and molecules can't move around and interact to form the chemistry necessary for life.
But if temperatures and conditions are just right, like here on Earth, you get liquid water.
The water allows the sand grains to flow together and intermingle and form more complex structures.
In the same way, water acts like a cocktail mixer, allowing the atoms and molecules to come together and ultimately form the building blocks of life.
All that water was perfect for breeding life.
Lots of it.
It's estimated that since the emergence of Earth's first life form, 1 00 billion species have existed on the planet.
Millions are alive right now, and that fact alone tells scientists a lot as they comb the cosmos for alien life.
If we look for life in the universe we have to understand it will come in different shapes and sizes.
And the same thing occurs here on Earth.
Take this handful of dirt.
It's not just dirt, there's a lot going on in here.
There's an earthworm.
Go in a little more... ..and there are these tiny little mites.
Zoom in further... ..and there are these little creatures called protozoa.
And smaller still... ..there's bacteria, billions of them.
so you see, there really are a lot of living things in a handful of dirt and we should probably remember that if we ever go digging around on alien worlds.
Life isn't always something you can see with the naked eye.
In these piles of dirt lie the secrets to our origins.
And scientists are keeping that in perspective when they search for life in the cosmos.
You have to be looking for that bacterium first, because that's gonna be far more common.
If we don't find that, the chance of finding these tall, elegant, grey, ET guys is gonna be highly diminished.
so are there other Earths out there capable of supporting extraterrestrial life, or even bacteria?
We're closer than ever to finding the answers, because scientists have picked up the scent in this cosmic hunt.
In the hunt for alien life, scientists are focusing their efforts on finding small, rocky planets like Earth.
But searching for another Earth is like trying to find a needle in a million haystacks.
Because, from trillions of kilometres away, these small planets get lost in the blinding glare of their star's brightness.
The sad truth of the matter is that Earth-like planets are mere cosmic specks of dust, and, therefore, detecting them is really quite hard.
Hard, but not impossible.
Every now and again, the planet passes directly between us and the star.
And if it does that, it's like a little eclipse and the starlight drops.
It gets darker because the planet is blocking the light from that star.
And it turns out we can see that.
With this in mind, scientists built one of the world's most sensitive telescopes and launched it into space.
The mission, called Kepler, may not help us find extra terrestrial life but it could help us find its home.
Kepler will simply do one thing unbelievably well - measure the brightnesses of 1 00,000 stars over and over and over, looking for a few of those 1 00,000 stars that dim.
seeing the tiniest dim from a small planet travelling in front of a star thousands of light years away isn't easy to imagine, but the Kepler telescope is one of the most sensitive cameras ever built.
To give you an idea just how sensitive Kepler is, I'm gonna demonstrate using this massive World War ll searchlight.
The brightness of that searchlight represents the extreme luminosity of stars and I'm gonna use this tiny marble to represent the planet.
When this planet passes in front of the star, it blocks out a tiny fraction of the light, dimming the star by a very small amount.
And that's exactly what the Kepler spacecraft can detect.
Kepler can detect a .01 per cent change in a star's luminosity.
But even if it spots a dimming star, there's still another problem.
When Kepler sees a star that dims, it could be due to a speck of dust that crossed in front of the telescope.
There's a possibility of binary stars - two stars that orbit each other, thereby dimming the stars as one blocks the other.
To make sure Kepler's truly found a planet, scientists are using one of the largest Earth-based telescopes for confirmation.
This telescope will also determine the planet's mass and distance from its star.
scientists are most interested in the small, rocky worlds that sit in what's called the Goldilocks Zone.
Remember how important liquid water is to life?
If a planet is in the Goldilocks Zone, it's not too close and not too far from its star.
It'sjust right.
And it's possible for water to flow there as a liquid.
We obviously sit in the Goldilocks Zone, but in our solar system, Mars and Venus also do, but we've yet to find life on either of those two planets.
Knowing if a planet is inhabitable is not as straightforward as saying,
"Oh, we found a planet the size of the Earth and it's 90 million miles from a sun-like star."
Venus is uninhabitable and Mars is uninhabitable.
Why is Venus such a harsh, hideous environment, some 600 degrees Celsius or so?
And, of course, the answer for Venus, sadly, is that some greenhouse effect, global warming, has overtaken Venus.
When it formed over four billion years ago,
Venus had water, and probably vast oceans on its surface.
But there was also a lot of the greenhouse gas water vapour in the atmosphere, which blanketed and heated the planet.
And as Venus got hotter, more and more water from its surface evaporated into the atmosphere, trapping the heat even more.
On Earth, much of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is chemically bound to the rocks.
And it was this way on young Venus, too.
But when it got to about 400 degrees Celsius, this carbon dioxide started baking out of the rocks and into the atmosphere.
With an atmosphere of water vapour and carbon dioxide, this cycle kept going and going and the runaway greenhouse effect has left Venus dry, lifeless, and a scorching 480 degrees Celsius.
Even if it weren't that hot, the atmospheric pressure at the surface is 90 times the Earth's atmospheric pressure, so you'd be crushed.
And it has sulphuric acid rain.
You know, Venus is basically, by every definition, Hell.
And yet, if you were to detect Venus orbiting another star, you might suspect it would have Earth-like conditions.
Mars also lies in the Goldilocks Zone, but it has the opposite problem of Venus.
It doesn't have enough greenhouse gases to trap in heat and it's become a cold, barren, desert world.
We have two examples of how planets have gone astray and we have to wonder how many other ways are there that a planet can fail to be habitable.
With so many ways a habitable planet can be rendered uninhabitable,
Kepler's findings are crucial, because the more potential homes it finds, the better the chance life might exist outside our little Earth.
In five years, we will know for certain, from Kepler's results, how frequent Earth-like planets are.
It will do this by only looking at 1 00,000 stars out of at least 200 billion in our galaxy.
But how is it possible to calculate the number of Earth-like planets orbiting other stars without looking at all the stars?
It's like asking how many blades of grass are there on this soccer field.
I could either get down on my hands and knees here and spend the rest of my life counting every single one or I could do what Kepler's going to do, which we call sampling.
We have a little grid - two inches by two inches on each side.
All I have to do now is count the number of blades of grass in that little two-inch square and then multiply by the number of squares that would cover this whole field.
One, two, three... 24, 25, 26, 27... 33, 34, 35... 47...
I wonder if I counted that one.
207.
207 blades of grass in a two inch by two inch patch.
Now, let's get out the calculator here and see what that means.
207 divided by two inches by two inches means 52 blades of grass per square inch.
Now we need the number of square inches in this field.
It's 1 80 by 360.
Wow, that's almost 1 0 million square inches in this field.
so, multiply that by 52 - half a billion blades of grass and I only had to count 207.
If Kepler does find Earth-like planets, this method of sampling will bring us one step closer to understanding how many habitable homes are in our galaxy.
Even if one out of a thousand stars in the Milky Way galaxy has a planet like the Earth that means there are millions and millions of Earths orbiting other stars.
so if you ask me:
is there life out there?
it seems awfully likely.
In the grand scope of the cosmos, we've considered ourselves pretty lucky to be at just the right spot and to have all the right ingredients for life to emerge.
But is it really luck?
Or does life find a way?
There are new discoveries showing us there might just be another recipe for life to emerge.
We have a general idea of what conditions are crucial for life to thrive on a planet.
We know liquid water plays a role, and we know life needs an energy source.
For us, that's our sun.
And for a long time, scientists believed that every single life form on Earth got their energy from our star.
That was until an underwater explorer, who discovered the Titanic, also helped discover something else deep in the ocean.
By far, the most important discovery I've ever made was not the Titanic.
It was when we discovered this whole new life system on our planet.
We thought all life needed access to sunlight, but working with the Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institute,
Bob Ballard found a thriving ecosystem where there was no sunlight.
There were creatures we'd never seen before.
One of the dominant organisms was what we call a tube worm and these were 6, 8 feet tall, and they had human-like blood.
And when they wanted to respirate, they would stick out the tube, basically their lung.
Prior to that discovery, we thought that all life on the Earth owed its existence to the sun.
Without sunlight, there was something else giving this life energy.
It was coming from deep inside the Earth's core.
something called black smokers, or hydrothermal vents, were bringing up minerals from deep underground.
And this was an amazing discovery because the temperature coming out of the bottom of the ocean was 650 degrees Fahrenheit.
Hot enough to melt lead.
Amazingly, this life thrived in an extremely hostile environment, which meant we needed to expand our narrow view of where life might be found.
We have to understand that life will evolve under conditions which seem horribly hostile, horribly alien.
And yet, it not only evolves and works, it thrives and has a whole ecosystem that depends on these bizarre environments.
And the bizarre environments didn't stop at the bottom of the ocean.
Life is found in the worst environments you could imagine.
Like the boiling hot springs of Yellowstone national park.
The hot springs at Yellowstone can be PH1 , just like battery acid... ..and 1 94 degrees.
If you went into this, it would dissolve you.
Dr Mark Young is an astrobiologist looking very closely at Yellowstone's hot springs.
He thinks these acid pits may be one of our biggest clues to understanding how life emerged on Earth.
Three billion years ago, planet Earth was much more like what we see in Yellowstone - boiling acid, very high temperatures, where life was dependent not so much on photosynthesis, but on the chemicals that are found
and the gases that come out of the boiling hot springs like Yellowstone.
Those pits in Yellowstone are just nasty.
In fact, the acid in them can dissolve just about anything.
I have some acid here that's a little more concentrated than you'll find in Yellowstone, but the results will be the same.
Now watch what happens to this penny when I drop it in the acid.
I'm gonna put this bell jar over to control the environment.
The green colour is copper coming from the penny and a noxious fume is being emitted.
And that's an oxide of nitrogen that is very hazardous, and I'm glad I have it in a bell jar.
What amazes me is that scientists are finding life aplenty in environments similar to that, and that just goes to show that life can flourish in even the harshest conditions.
We're finding micro-organisms not only living in these hot springs but flourishing.
Wherever there's liquid water - no matter the amount of light, the temperature, the acidity - life thrives.
This revolutionary discovery is opening us up to the possibility that life may exist in places we never thought possible.
Even under the surfaces of planets or nearby moons.
What's incredible is that it turns out that even in our own little solar system, there are diversity places where there could be life.
In 2008, a probe visited to the Martian surface, the Phoenix Mars Lander, and it made an amazing discovery.
Phoenix dug down into the dirt, and after only a couple of inches, uncovered crystals of frozen water.
The key question is; how far down does the water persist beneath the surface and if you go far enough, is the pressure and temperature high enough that the water would be liquid, not in the form of ice?
And there's a very good suggestion, I think, that there are, in fact, liquid aquifers.
We might be able to drill down and find the evidence, if any, of life on Mars at this moment.
And scientists are also excited about what they believe to be an ocean underneath the surface of Jupiter's frozen moon, Europa.
sure, it's cold and solid in the form of ice on the surface, but almost certainly, beneath the ice on Europa is a vast ocean, hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres thick.
Europa sits well outside the Goldilocks Zone, but just like at the bottom of Earth's oceans, hydrothermal vents could be the energy source needed for life to emerge.
Those ocean depths could be home to some bizarre life forms - huge tubeworms feeding on the minerals coming from inside Europa's core.
There's no telling what kind of life may exist in Europa's ocean.
But one of the most fascinating places in our solar system is saturn's largest moon, Titan.
Titan's atmosphere and surface features are similar to Earth's 3.5 billion years ago.
Titan is one of the larger moons in the solar system and the only one to have a substantial atmosphere.
And the atmosphere has lots of methane in it.
And it's cold enough that the methane precipitates and drops, like raindrops, and falls out onto the surface of Titan.
Not liquid water, but liquid methane.
On Earth, methane is a flammable gas, but the temperatures on Titan are so cold, minus 1 80 degrees Celsius, that the methane can form liquid.
Titan actually has lakes, rain and rivers made of liquid natural gas, liquid methane.
That probably isn't quite as good as water, but at least it's a medium.
Things can flow around, begin to form bonds.
Fluid is where it's at.
The idea that life can emerge from a different kind of liquid is adding a whole new dimension to our search.
It's possible that life elsewhere in the universe can thrive with other liquids, not just water, and so we have to keep our eyes open.
Other environments very different from that on the Earth could harbour life.
New discoveries constantly shift our perspective on where alien life might exist.
And as we continue investigating the clues to this cosmic mystery, we have to remember to keep an open mind.
Because life out there might be stranger than Hollywood could have ever dreamt up.
The hunt for life in the cosmos is intensifying.
New discoveries have opened us up to the possibility that life could exist closer than we ever imagined, right in our own solar system.
But even if that doesn't pan out, there are billions of stars out there just like our sun
with potentially billions of planets harbouring life, like Earth.
It's completely reasonable to think that there's life out there.
There's just so many possibilities - billions of stars and billions of galaxies, and dah-duh, dah-duh, dah-duh.
surely there's life out there.
Finding life, even primitive microbial life, would change our place in the universe by telling us that we're not alone.
And it would most likely be an indication that we're getting closer to finding an intelligent civilisation.
It would be really fun if we could find an alien that could, you know, send me an email or twitter or whatever, all day long, but the profound question is life or nonlife.
Once we have the microbial, we have the potential for intelligence.
But if we don't have a life form at all, we don't have the potential for anything.
What if we do find complex life out there?
What would it look like?
Would it be anything like what we see in Hollywood movies?
It is humorous that Hollywood depicts aliens more or less the same way.
There's a Klingon here and a Romulan there and there's slanty eyes and, you know, big old brains and so on.
Any sort of alien that resembles a human is ludicrous - two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.
There's no reason an alien would have to be adapted this way.
Over hundreds of millions of years, all the creatures of our planet have adapted to their environment, so the chemistries are similar, which means your genetic makeup isn't all that different from an earthworm, or even your pet.
Basically, all animals are worms.
We're worms - we've got a head, we've got a tail.
We're long and skinny and that's how we move forward.
Dinosaurs are worms.
What people don't understand is that evolution is not a road map.
Humans are not at the top of the evolutionary ladder.
We're not the end point, the goal of evolution, or anything like that.
We're accidents, we're random.
We eat through our mouths but we breathe through our mouths and we can choke on food.
That's a terrible design.
It's an accident of evolution.
Maybe aliens evolved differently.
Maybe they don't need to breathe.
Maybe they can get oxygen in some other way.
Anything like that can go, as long as it makes sense for the environment.
so life on another planet would adapt to its environment and could be stranger than you could ever imagine.
It's fun to speculate about how life might evolve under conditions that are very different from those here on the earth.
If you lived on a planet with twice the gravity of Earth, there'd be a lot more pull on your body and you'd come crashing down twice as hard if you fell.
so perhaps creatures there would have stronger, stockier bodies with more legs closer to the ground.
A planet with very little gravity would be like our moon or Mars.
I can imagine a creature on a low gravity planet as being... long and spindly.
Life on a low gravity planet might be tall and thin, with long legs.
If life evolved on a very dense planet where the atmosphere is soupy or water-like, you could see creatures as big as whales or elephants actually flying, not through the air, but through this liquid-like atmosphere.
I think we are currently ignorant, actually, about the real realistic diversity of life elsewhere.
Life in the universe may be incredibly diverse.
But could it all have come from the same place?
Panspermia is the idea espoused at the beginning of the classic Battlestar Galactica that life here began out there.
The building blocks of life on our planet may have originated elsewhere and were transported here when a meteorite collided with Earth.
Comets have a lot of organic materials on them.
some meteorites have amino acids in them.
These are the building blocks, the precursors, of life.
so at least the building blocks of life could have come from space.
It seems unimaginable because life, or the building blocks of life, would have had to survive an impact with our planet.
Here at nasa's Ames Research Center in northern California, astronomer Peter schultz and his team are testing to see if this theory of Panspermia is even remotely possible.
It's good.
Here I've got the projectile that is embedded with some organics.
so the real question is; will this survive if we hammer it at a high speed?
We're gonna be firing this at around three-and-a-half kilometres per second.
This would be about the speed of something surviving entry into the atmosphere.
schultz will create a high-speed impact using nasa's vertical gun, which will fire the projectile at 1 6,000 kilometres per hour, that's ten times faster than a bullet.
This is a pretty special gun.
It uses a lot of gunpowder but then compresses hydrogen gas, and then it's released, and then the hydrogen gas expands.
When it expands, the projectile continues on down into the impact chamber and that's when things happen.
This is where it all happens.
This is the impact chamber.
The projectile's gonna come through this hole, slam into this target, which is about two feet across - this is just ordinary sand - and we'll see if it survives.
With the vertical gun loaded and the impact chamber set, it's time to test and see if the organic material laced onto the projectile can survive a high-speed impact.
This drives me nuts.
Oh!
OK.
This was...gorgeous.
Whoa!
I... I hope there's stuff left.
The key now is to go back in there, dig out these pieces and see if we can find any survivors, literally survivors.
We gotta go see what we did.
Oh, what a mess.
Oh, this is dynamite.
schultz scours the impact chamber, hunting for remnants of the projectile.
This is like looking for your lost contact on a beach.
Let's see what we have.
Oh, that is so sweet.
We did the experiment, we collected some pieces.
We showed that we actually got solid pieces that survived impact, and embedded within that solid piece are amino acids.
You can see it here in this image.
You can see the fracturing, but even though it's fractured, it's not melted.
Panspermia is not that far-fetched after all.
It says you can transport the seeds of life, if not life itself, from one planet to another.
However life began on our planet, it eventually evolved to develop intelligence.
And ultimately, our goal is to see if that's happened somewhere else in the universe.
What we're really looking for is, you know, spock.
We're looking for another civilisation that's either like us or not like us, but is clearly intelligent.
That's the Holy Grail of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
With so many stars and so many planets out there, it would truly be a surprise if intelligent life did not exist somewhere in the universe, perhaps even nearby in our own galaxy.
With the closest stars light years away, is it possible to actually travel there?
Or will first contact be made some other way?
Right now, in our own Milky Way galaxy alone, there may be numerous intelligent alien civilisations.
But why haven't we contacted or been contacted by any of them?
First of all, there's a lot of empty space out there.
The very nearest star to us is four light years away.
They could send us a signal, in four years' time it would get here, and then we could reply eight years later to them.
That's the closest star.
What about communicating with people across the galaxy where there are tens of thousands or a hundred thousand light years in between?
If we wanted to pop over and borrow a cup of sugar, it would take some 700,000 years for us to bring the sugar home.
so that's a very big problem.
With the nearest star 400 trillion kilometres away, our current technology could get us there in, say, 1 00,000 years, so travelling to see an alien civilisation clearly isn't going to work.
But how about we just call them up?
After all, radio signals travel at the speed of light.
If we are going to communicate with aliens, that's gonna be the most boring conversation we've ever had, because if they're beaming radio waves at us and they're 1 00 light years away, and they say, "Hey, how's the weather down there on Earth?"
It takes a hundred years to get here and we say,
"Hey, it's fine.
How are things there on Globnarp?"
Another hundred years back and forth.
It's a century travel time.
That's a boring conversation.
The chances that two intelligent civilisations have the ability to communicate, the desire to communicate, and are around long enough to communicate makes this cosmic chat even tougher.
so we've been intelligent in the sense we've had the same brain size for about 1 00,000 years.
Yet we've only been able to communicate for the past 50 years - a tiny fraction, meaning if another civilisation communicated with us 200 years ago, we would have missed the signal altogether.
There can be a lot of miscommunications when trying a cosmic chat.
We could think of communicating with an alien civilisation as like a game of cosmic catch.
The stadium...is the galaxy.
And the ball is our message.
so if we send the ball out into the stadium, odds are nobody's there to receive it.
Of course, we could luck out and actually send our message towards an alien civilisation.
But what if that civilisation was technologically 500 years or more behind where we are?
Well, that would be like throwing a baseball to a baby.
Of course, if everything is just right and there is another technological civilisation out there capable of receiving our message...
Here you go.
Well, that would be our first contact with an extraterrestrial civilisation.
since it would be a long time before we could have a face-to-face conversation, the best thing we can do for now isjust to listen.
At the search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, seth shostack is doing just that.
These are the individual antennas of the Allen telescope array. It's one of the most powerful observatories in the world and, in fact, the kind of thing that could check out millions of star systems.
If you can check out a few million star systems, you have a really good chance of finding a signal from ET.
Radio waves or TV signals have recognisable patterns, so shostack and other scientists are listening for deliberate signals from an alien planet.
These telescopes listen to hundreds of thousands to millions of stars at the same time and they do it 24 hours a day.
These distances between stars are enormously vast.
Most interstellar visiting is gonna be via signalling, not by actual visiting.
And what are we broadcasting out into the cosmos?
Television transmissions have been travelling away from the earth for about 50 years.
I Love Lucy and Gilligan's Island have been broadcast to the galaxy, travelling at the speed of light, and they are our emissaries, they are our diplomats to the galaxy.
Our ultra-high frequency and microwave radio signals have been expanding into space at the speed of light.
These radio, radar, and television signals fill a sphere nearly 1 00 light years in diameter, so any civilisation within 1 00 light years of Earth might be hearing our voices or watching our television shows.
We're sending transmissions out into the cosmos, but suppose we detect a signal from an alien civilisation.
How would we respond?
It's something we've thought about a lot.
The United Nations has even drawn up a manifesto about what we would do.
When the day comes that we pick up a transmission from an alien civilisation, we as a species, frankly, will face our greatest challenge ever, I think.
It raises the question, who represents Earth?
Who represents the Homo sapiens?
And I think the only way to decide this will be with some very seriously thought-out process.
But if we do pick up a signal from an alien race, not everyone thinks it's such a good idea to answer back.
There will be those who, I think, understandably, will argue that we humans should remain hidden in the great galactic tall grasses, because, of course, maybe they're hungry, for example, and would like some hors d'oeuves.
Would aliens really want to do us harm?
Probably not.
Aliens we contact will at least have learned to live with themselves peacefully.
For them to exist in any numbers in the galaxy, they would have to have long lifetimes as intelligent, technological, communicating civilisations.
We are closer than ever to finding answers to one of mankind's greatest questions..
Are we alone?
There is something in us that wants to find our place.
What is our purpose?
Maybe that purpose is just to be nice to each other and just to seek and explore and to discover.
We are exploring and every discovery we make will help us understand our very existence.
We want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.
We know deep down that our lives are flickering moments of glory.
We would like to know that there's a higher purpose, that we're a part of something bigger.
Are we simply one small piece in the cosmicjigsaw puzzle or are we truly the only special beings in this vast universe?
Finding the answer could be mankind's greatest challenge.

If the Elder GodsNlearn of our plot we shall bothNsuffer the consequences
I do not understand
How can you fear the Elder Gods?
Nour power will be absolute
Until the sixth dayNhas passed we can take no chancesNwith Rayden and his mortals
Do not underestimateNthe power of the human spirit
if anything happens to me
I have lost everything
too
The missile!
You must go
There will be others
I killed you
You killed my older brother
Why did you help us?
I helped her
Legend says the princessNis the key to stopping Kahn
You've been following usNWhy?
Kahn reprogrammed SmokeNto come after you in order to keep you apartNfrom Queen Sindel
How do we get to Nightwolf?
NSub-Zero
You must help usNif you want to stop Kahn
Let's hope you succeed
Get over here!
Take it!
Suckers!
I've got to find Kitana
Kahn wants you to go after her
Don't it's over
You alone are not readyNfor what's ahead
You'll take the same track backNand turn where I showed you
Don't worry about me
Is it like this everywhere?
the mergerNof the realms grows closer
More of the earthNwill be destroyed
I will meet youNat the temple of the Elder Gods
Jax!
Thought I was supposedNto be rescuing you
I couldn't wait
What have you doneNto yourself now?
Cybernetic strength-enhancers
It quadruplesNyour muscle capacity
You've got a confidence problem
These locks must beNon some remote-access mechanism
What you doing here?
Everybody split
The facility will be trashedNby an extermination squad
Nextermination squad?
too
I don't even know them
Damn it!
I can't free you
Stand backNLet's see what I'm made of
That's what I'm talking about
Wish I had these in high school
You'll wishNyou were in high school
Hurry!
What is that?
Death is the only way out
Sonya BladeNShao-Kahn will be pleased
Shao what?
I'll take homeboy
I take it this ain't somethingNwe can talk about
Heads up!
Catch this!
Now what?
Cybernetic strength-enhancers!
Nice look but I'd lose the wall
I was just gettingNa feel for it
Watch out
You barbecued his ass
Look at this
Does this mean what I think?
Too bad I didn't get new legs
My squads have claimed thousandsNof innocent souls on earth
I will claim millions you'd be behind barsNin a zoo
Sheeva I would welcome them!
Silence!
What is your report?
Two of earth's best warriorsNhave been taken
Kabaal and Stryker
Did you make them begNbefore you destroyed them?
I thought if I let them live
I have no use for excuses!
Nthis will never happen again
It will never happen again
It is trueNthis will never happen again
I need a new general
You can die in dutyNor by my hand
Centaurs are knownNfor their hunting prowess
I will personallyNhunt down every human soul and spare no one!
Motaro can't be trusted
I proved myselfNas the protector of Sindel
Your orders are mine to follow
The energies they wasteNwith their sniveling I would use to capture souls
You are all too impetuousNfor such important work
NQueen Sindel unless anyoneNhas a different point of view
huh?
It's my animality
Who are you?
Wouldn't you like to know?
So you're Rayden's prodigy
I've seen better
Don't sweat it too
Nyou know I won Mortal Kombat
Don't get cocky
The tournament had rules anything goes
It was a mistake coming here
You think you're ready Nwould Kitana have been captured?
Can you help me get her back?
Maybe
Kitana is important
Nyou've got to pass three tests
First one's courage
I don't have timeNfor these stupid games!
To test your courageNand find your animality you've got to enterNa dream state
How am I supposed to do that?
There's a slow wayNand a fast way
No time for the slow way
That's what I thought you'd say
Sweet dreams
Nbut you failed me
You are not the warriorNI thought you were
What if I fail everyone?
Your brother's soul is mine!
Fight from the inside
Nyour faith in yourself that can never be defeated
The fire inside you is killed
You lost Kitana
You are not a leader
Find that power inside you
Feel your animality
You will fail!
I am Jade
I have searched the mesaNfor you
Of all the horrorsNdarkness holds to die alone that is my worst fear
I'm not afraid
This is almostNtoo good to be true
The sameNcould be said about you
My heart belongs to another
I can't
There's not much time left
Is this just another dream?
How can you beat Shao-KahnNwhen I am too much for you?
Nnow you laugh?
You are more pure and faithfulNthan I heard
You have passed the test
A test?
This was just another oneNof Nightwolf's tests?
We could have killed each other!
But we'll live
I will lead you to the templeNof the Elder Gods
I can't
Nit was only his second
I'm not ready
Not ready to save Kitana?
Because she's the key
I can take you to her
She's alive?
I cannot say
We must go
All your past betrayalsNI can forgive
Please accept this offering
I do not want your death
You test my patience
You destroyed my family
You drove my motherNto kill herself
I am your enemy forever
Kill me now if you dare
Foolish child
A struggling worm on a hook lands a bigger catchNthan a dead one
no animals
What's going on here?
Nature's dying
The merger of the realmsNis almost done
You keep talkingNabout mergers and realms but it don't mean squat to me
I can't explain it
We've only got a few days
Use your imagination
Use my imagination?
Nand I'm gonna split
You dragged me out the baseNwith some killers after us take meNhalfway around the world
Ntell me why
Nobody told meNwhy Johnny had to die
What is it with you?
Who the hell is Johnny?
I'm your partner
Nwho can you trust?
Nobody but me
Nobody but you?
NI was there
I'm in the middle of nowhereNbecause of you!
I need to use the rest roomNI got no toilet tissue
I got metal on my hands!
You wish
I told you these arms were goodNfor something
Thanks
I owe you one
I don't know how much longerNI can take this
You look good in mud
You do
I got to find a river
We better roll
They don't use parachutes
I have comeNto the eternal palace because your sacred rulesNhave been broken
Shao-Kahn has invaded the earth
Nyou are granted three questions
Why was this treachery allowed?
We do not control man's destiny
Everyone can change their fate
You'll stand by and watchNthe ruination of earth?
You are correct
Kitana is the keyNto closing Kahn's portals
If I reunite her with Sindel how can I be sure Kahn's portalsNwill stay closed?
Only when Shao-Kahn is destroyedNwill the future be safe
Do you believe the humansNare worth saving?
More than anything I know
Do you love them enoughNto sacrifice your immortality?
Nmailboxes
Which temple's the Elder Gods'?
Keep moving
You know this dude?
Is that Jax?
Who is she?
this is Sonya Blade
Major Jackson Briggs
You've got incredible legsNfor kicking
Where Kitana?
She was kidnapped by Scorpion
You lost KitanaNand picked up her?
She helped me get here
Nwe got Kahn's squads on us
Can I make a suggestion?
Nlike staying alive
either
We're just gonna waitNfor this dude?
it's hopeless
Never give up hope
At least not so early
It's a new look
Who's she?
Can she fightNas good as she looks?
Better because I was expectingNa team of fighters
I hear fightersNat war with each other
Give us a breakNWe've been through hell
Nyou've been through nothing
Where's Kitana?
Kahn took herNIt's all my fault
This is not about blame
We're together in this like a family
What's with your arms?
Nand you're dissin' me already?
I mean no disrespect
You have real skills
Those arms aren't your strengthNThey're your weakness
Thanks for the tip
These thingsNare state of the art
Faith in yourselfNis all you need
I say that to all of you
I'll try to open a portalNto Outworld
Follow me!
My powers are leaving me
NMoses parting the Red Sea?
Destroy everything!
Whenever you're ready
Come on
That was fun
They have taken the baitNand fallen into our trap
Proceed as planned
I will await your arrivalNin Outworld
Nbut I'm freezing inside
Feels like I got microwaved
You never get used to that
Is that what I think it is?
The realms are merging
This will continue unlessNKahn's portals are closed
Time is against us
People in their carsNTorn between realms
It's like a nightmare
We have to stop this
Nwe must rescue Kitana
I know Kahn took KitanaNto his fortress
Hold up Kahn?
You mean Mr Bad Attitude?
You want to check out his crib?
No way
I ain't goingNon no suicide mission
Jax is right
That's probablyNwhat Kahn wants us to do
There is a secret passageway
I used it to escape
How could you believeNthe ruination of the temple would not jeopardize our plan?
It was necessaryNto convince the mortals their only hope lie in Outworld
You seem confident that SindelNwill capture them in your trap on my soul
All the millenniums of planningNwill be rewarded
You will be proud
Know this I will take your soul myselfNif you fail
I will rallyNthe extermination squads and prepare for victory
The mergerNwill soon be complete
All your friends will be dead
This must have been Edenia
The royal family's temple
Kitana said I'd find it here
She's having a bad hair day
They must have followed us
but it may beNa blessing in disguise
We need SindelNto close Kahn's portals forever
I'll take care of herNI'll rescue Kitana
Something finally went rightNWe won
Who finished off Sindel?
NI surprised her from behind
Maybe she came in handyNafter all
You are witness to the dawningNof mankind's final day!
The two realms will be one!
Rayden and his mortalsNhave fallen for my trick and failed to stop us
Bring Rayden and his mortalsNto bow at my feet
Nthey can witness the birth of the greatest armyNin existence!
It's a trap Leave!
Up there!
The date's over
Only your love can reunite her body and soul
Kitana your love can break the holdNKahn has over your mother and close his portals to earth
I have prayed for the day when our love will bring us together again
I have never loved you
Nwhat reason was there to love?
I knew it could not be true
It cannot be
But it can and it is
And you are powerless
Thunder God
It's over
You fools
You've been tricked
The legend was a lie
Kahn's portals stay open
Now the mergerNis nearly complete
How could you do this?
It was so easy
Jade
That's it man
And what happens?
You take usNon a wild goose chase
I don't understand
You were advisedNby the other gods
The gods must've lied to me
Forget your gods and immortals and all that junk!
The only ones we can trustNfrom here on out are humans not even Rayden
Don't you understand?
Nhe is mortal now like you
All his powersNhave been sacrificed
That's even worse
How do we stop Kahn now?
There's more to this than Kahn then KahnNhas a higher allegiance
Wait a second
That tattooNI've seen it before
On a robot and a woman
They both tried to kill me
And both of themNworked for Kahn
This tattoo is a family crest bestowed only to my bloodline
It is a permanent mark that allows safe passageNthrough the portals for the bearerNand his passengers
Did the tattoos you sawNflee the fighter upon death?
Like a bat out of hell
Temporary passes
The did not share my bloodline
But if it's your family crest too?
My father is an Elder God
And only they can bestowNsuch a marking
Your dad's an Elder God?
Funny how you failedNto mention that before
If your father's an Elder God what does that make Kahn?
Shao-Kahn is my brother
It was not my fault
I did everything you ordered
It was your jobNto lure them to an ambush
Nthen you failed me!
We could neverNhave stopped them alone
Listen to her
She speaks the truth
We would've died trying
You
You are already dead!
And you will be soon
You will mount a defenseNaround my newest temple
Prepare for Rayden to makeNone last attack
You said RaydenNwas no longer to be feared
I am to be feared!
If you fail me I will feedNyour rotting corpse to the worms!
Your hallowed positionNatop the worm pile appears to be most tenuous
Now your failureNwill be my opportunity
you gotNone dysfunctional family
Nmy father decreed his heir to the family throneNmust be strong enough to kill his own brotherNin battle if necessary
I beat my brother but I could not kill him
Only one thing is certain
Kahn must die
This time you'll kill him
I could not then
I cannot now
So what do we do?
You will do your best
It is all that can be expected
I will pray for you all
Listen to me
Liu is our only hope
I want to fight Kahn but I may not be ready
You must believe in yourself
We believe in you
My home
The TempleNof the Order of Light
Your family
There's so little time left
Whatever time we have we must use well
Are we really ready to die here?
If we die we will die in battle
Together
Prepare for final battle!
son the mergerNof realms will be complete you aloneNhave the power to end this
Stop!
I do not want to remember youNthis weak!
It is not weak to value life!
Rayden
To rule all realmsNwith your family
They are my family
Then you shall die with the restNof your pathetic human race!
Finish him!
You should have killed me when you had the chance brother
My brother died a long time ago anyway
I win brother
You cannot die
I am proud to die a mortal
Like you
This is the beginningNof the end!
Show them the way to oblivion!
Mr Ed is mine
I'll take my mother
Leftovers are fine with me
I'll make you eat that thing
I can't takeNtoo much more of this
Is that all you got?
Is that any wayNto treat your mother?
My mother's dead
As soon will be her daughter
Kahn
Pathetic and weak
Clearly Rayden has molded youNin his image
Without your weapons you are no match for Motaro
help!
I got everything I needNright here!
Help!
Get off her
Sonya
NI'm fine huh?
huh?
Whatever you are you will liveNto see the end of Kahn to give my mother's soul peace
Liu Kang
You will fail!
I can feel
Now I done seen everything
Impressive
You've come prepared
But not good enough
Kahn
Just like the blood of a mortal
How can this be?
I warned youNthere would be consequences for breaking the sacred rules
But I did not expect this
Must I do everything for you?
The fate of the universe will be decided as it should be
In Mortal Kombat
Nnor mine!
and I will!
That was the longest weekNof my life
Jax
Could've been worse
Could've been the last weekNof our lives
I guess that's right
What's up with that?
Was I dead?
It is only rightNthat Shinnok's son be allowed to take his placeNin the Eternal Palace
You've become one of us
Liu
You've all made me very proud
I will be watching you so stay out of trouble
And remember be there for one another
Previously on Siberia...
A tiger!
A fucking tiger!
I couldn't believe it.
It was like something a seven year old would tell me...
"Oh, I saw a tiger in the woods..."
- What are you doing?
- Wondering what would do that to a tiger.
Oh, hell.
It's on fire...
and it's green...
- What's on fire?
- The sky.
You know, there's something about Carolina.
I feel like I recognize her.
- Fire in the woods, man.
- Got to get some water.
I told you this was a mistake!
That's all we had, man.
That's all we had.
Does anyone recognize this?
We found Johnny's shirt.
And it was full of food from the shed.
I get what it looks like.
I see that.
But I didn't steal the food, and I didn't burn down the shed.
Someone obviously doesn't like me, and they're trying to set me up.
People weren't taking too kindly me being at camp 'cause apparently I stole food from the shed and then burned it down.
Someone framed me. They wrapped my shirt around some food, hid it in the woods.
I don't know who did it.
You know, frankly, I don't really care anymore, you know?
I don't really need them anyways.
You know, obviously, I can take care of myself.
Took them how long to build a fire?
I did it in five minutes in the dark.
I can't believe Johnny's gonna just stay out in the woods.
And why shouldn't he?
After all the crap that he's pulled?
He'll be fine.
And if he's not, you got a better chance of winning.
And you can keep his bed.
I want to make it to the end, but I want to do it as a team, kind of like how Neeko's doing it, you know?
Can I tell you something?
Sure.
You're a smart guy.
You know that Neeko is a professional athlete?
He plays game for living.
How about maybe he's playing this game that he's a very nice guy, everybody trusts him, just to win the game?
Have you ever thought about it?
I don't think you should trust him.
Can't trust anybody.
Guys?
I get up early, and as soon as I open the door, I practically ran into this spear that's stuck in the ground.
It felt like a threat.
Let me see.
What does it say?
It says...
What is that?
It means "get out."
It's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell's going on here.
It's a nice prop.
Look at it.
It's not real.
Nice scare tactic.
They're watching.
I'm sure they're loving this.
Why is it in front of our cabin and not yours?
Who wants you guys to get out?
Well, this is here on purpose.
That's for sure.
It's here on purpose.
It's here for a reason.
You guys gonna be so gullible to fall for this, really?
Who else could've left that spear?
Besides Production, who could've done it?
We're the only people out here.
Aren't we?
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I mean, aren't you still scared?
The spear this morning telling us to leave?
That doesn't scare you at all?
I think, at this point, it's just all mind games.
I miss home.
I miss my family.
I even miss my stupid ex-boyfriend.
This place is-- it's getting to me.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about pushing the button.
I don't want you to go.
You know what I mean?
I think-- I think we can win this.
We just need to--
But I don't need to stay.
I don't understand why I'm even staying.
I don't need the money that badly.
I do.
Annie.
I've been a lone wolf for a while, you know?
I've been on my own for a while.
I'm probably, without knowing it, less lonely than I have been in a long time because I'm interacting with people more often than I have in many years.
Now I consider Daniel a friend.
He's a good kid.
If I had a son, I'd be proud if he was like Daniel.
What are you looking at?
- Just watching those two. - Mm-hmm.
I don't want to overstep my bounds, you know.
I don't know how she feels about me, and so I'm just kind of--
I'm taking it slow, but at the same time, it's really hard 'cause I really want to, you know, see where this is gonna go.
I don't know.
At the same time, I don't want to get hurt.
Don't worry.
She knows you exist.
How would I really get her to?
I don't know, like...
Get her to what?
Like me like me.
You can't get her to like you.
Either she does or she doesn't.
You know?
How beautiful is it?
This is so nice.
_
Why not?
_
I'm sorry.
I'm being naughty.
It's beautiful in, though.
_
You must be hot.
Come on.
_
- No good... _
- No one's here.
- It's trouble.
No one's here.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
You want to come.
- Oh, yeah?
_
You'll thank me once you're in here.
It's beautiful.
_
Careful.
_
I'm gonna film us.
_
It's a great idea.
You promise you'll erase it?
_
- Promise me?
- I promise.
Good.
Annie?
Wait, Annie.
You shouldn't be walking out here alone.
It's not safe.
_
What are you talking about?
Come on, it's not safe.
Stop.
Wait.
Don't be like this.
Be like what?
Look, I--
It's not the same thing for me, okay?
I'm not going back to a life or a job that I like or family or friends or even an ex-boyfriend, and I get that you're sad about that.
But you're forgetting about who's here for you right now, and you're turning your back on me.
No, I'm not.
I like her.
It's been a while since I've been with anybody, but I--
We get along so well.
I just feel like a dumbass now.
I mean, she's probably not gonna talk to me for the rest of the time, if she does stay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- There you are.
- How's it going?
Good.
I just wanted to talk to you.
Uh-huh?
Um, so, Victoria's gone.
Um, I'm just wondering what's going on with her bed.
Oh, it's-- well, it's free right now.
So no one would mind if I moved in?
Um... yeah, yeah.
I mean, I don't mind. I don't know what the other girls other think, but it's good with me.
Awesome.
All right, I'll go grab my things.
It's not that I didn't have fun with the boys.
I don't know.
I just feel like my time there is done.
It's served its purpose, and I want to--
I want to get to know the girls a bit better.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
You mean the show?
No, you idiot.
I'm gonna move into Victoria's old bed.
Wait.
Why?
Why?
Because it's free.
I know, but I thought you liked it here with me.
You said we are great roommates.
Yes, we were, and thank you for letting me stay.
Just, I don't know.
I want to be with the girls now.
Come on, Esther.
Don't you think we should team up?
We are both smarter than everyone else here.
We can win this thing-- together.
Ohh, I like your style.
I will think about it.
But hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.
I was just thinking that we could have something...
You thought what?
That we could get romantic a little bit?
Don't laugh.
Really?
I don't do romance.
Look, we're playing a game.
What do you mean?
I'm playing a game-- for money.
I don't do romance, and I'm not playing a dating game.
I'm sorry.
Fuck you, bitch!
Fuck you, bitch!
You're not going anywhere.
Get the fuck off me!
I'm kidding.
I was just kidding, Esther.
I'm just kidding.
Esther.
Don't you fucking touch me again.
Come on!
I'm just- - I was just kidding!
I think I was in shock.
I-I don't know.
It happened so quickly.
But he grabbed me here, pushed me up against the bunk, and then he backed off.
Esther is a player.
We all know that.
And I played with her, too.
So she was on the way out.
I just pushed her a little bit on the bed, just jokingly, like pretending that I'm like scaring her.
"You're gonna stay here," or something.
She just, like, freaked out.
She pushed me away.
She's like, "don't talk to me like that."
Stormed out, like mad.
And I was just telling her, "I'm joking.
You know me.
I always joke around.
I was just joking with you."
I didn't get it, seriously.
She just freaked out, and it was just a pure joke.
What are you showing me?
It was right here.
Are you sure?
Big huge carcass.
Guts hanging out and everything.
Look.
Look at what?
The blood?
It could've been anything.
It could've been a bird.
It could've been a deer.
Why would I make this up?
Why would I lie?
There was a huge-- there was a huge tiger there.
I guess they took it.
The producers took it.
The producers?
I think she thinks that I could've been trying to scare her, play a sick joke on her.
I was kind of a bit shocked because I didn't think she saw me as that kind of person.
For all I know, Johnny took it. Johnny took it?
He probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something.
I don't know.
Oh, now Johnny does everything?
Not only do we have to worry about the producers playing mind games with us, we got to worry about that guy.
Hopefully he's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here.
I don't think he's as bad as you think.
Why are you always defending him?
Why are you always defending him?
I'm telling you that guy's dangerous.
I'm kind of baffled where it's gone, you know, 'cause this thing was pretty big, you know.
It would've taken a lot of force or something pretty hefty to get it out of there, and there was no trail.
There was no kind of like a trail of where it could've been dragged to.
It's like it was almost picked up and gone.
Got some traps set up along this way somewhere.
I found some deer trails I scouted earlier.
Hope they catch something.
The first night in the woods by myself was pretty awesome, actually.
Had a nice little fire.
Weather was nice.
You know, wrapped up.
It was nice being on my own.
It's what I wanted to do originally, too, is, you know, be by myself, take care of myself, do my own thing, and I got that, so pretty content.
What the hell did this, man?
This thing's...
I mean, it, obviously, it ripped the deer while it was standing here.
It was strong enough to rip it off-- rip the, like, rip its bone in half.
What do you want?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to catch some food, but something got to it before me, it looks like.
What do you want?
I just came to try to convince you to come back.
Try to convince me to come back, to the camp?
Yeah, I don't think it's safe for you to be out here.
I think it's safer here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don't like me thanks to you, making those wild accusations.
Just, whatever happened, I don't think it's safe for you to stay out here.
Well, you know what?
I really don't need you trying to be nice to me.
I'll be fine on my own, okay?
I can take care of myself.
Y'all try taking care of yourselves, too, all right?
Okay, fine.
If that's how you want to be, then fine.
Fine.
Nah, that's-- that's not good enough.
That ain't good enough.
Hey, Irene.
Hey, Dan.
Whatcha doing?
Collecting some acorns.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
If you mash them up, you can make like a paste and make a pancake out of it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Is it-- does it taste good?
I think so.
You want me to help?
Oh, sure.
That'd be great.
Yeah.
They're kind of scattered all over.
Daniel is a really, really nice, really sweet person, and he has such a gentle-- a very gentle spirit,
I guess you can say.
Hey.
It's a Siberian squill.
I'm not really big on flowers.
Why not?
Well, you know, they're pretty, but it's kind of odd, the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower 'cause it's like, "Oh, you know, I like you, so let me give you something that's dying."
It never really made sense to me.
Something more permanent would be nice, you know, even a rock would be better.
She's got so much complexity to her, you know?
I find out something new about her every day, it seems like, and it's a pretty big thing that I would've never expected out of her.
It's...
She's just-- she's amazing.
Where are we?
I can't find the path.
We're lost.
- We're not lost.
- No, we're lost.
I don't know where we're going.
In the middle of the wood, very close to the river, I found this really weird-looking tree.
I mean, it wasn't a tree.
It was something different.
It had a face shape.
It had hair.
What?
My name is Miljan.
It's really nice to meet you.
What is your name?
Ogdee?
This is my friend Ogdee.
We go way back, man.
He's so bad.
I spoke to it.
We had a little conversation.
Ogdee is my old friend from high school.
I'm kidding.
Esther.
- What?
_
_
_ _
_ _
_
_
_ _
_
_
_ _
_
_
_
_
Where have you been?
Out.
Out?
Where do you go all day, anyway?
Okay.
I can't believe you got us so lost.
We're not lost.
Yes, we are.
Where are we?
Do you know where we are?
We're in Siberia.
Not funny.
Oh, God!
What is that?
Did you hear that?
I heard it.
Come on.
There might be something out here.
Come on.
Oh! Oh, God!
What are you doing out here?
Sorry.
I'm going to get water.
Where are you going?
Home-- where the hell is it?
That way.
Why is she being such a bitch?
Why are you here, by the way, alone?
No reason.
That's suspicious.
Shut up, Miljan.
Guys, have you seen Carolina?
No.
She hasn't come back.
You mean she's not back yet?
She's not back.
I have no idea where she is.
I haven't seen her.
You do know she's out there with Johnny?
Yeah, tell me about it.
I know.
Well, I don't know about you, but I feel like I should go and look for her.
I don't-- I don't feel comfortable with her with Johnny.
Before it gets too late, I think we should.
I'm game, yeah.
- You're gonna come with me?
- Yeah.
Gentlemen.
Where the hell were you?
I was in the woods.
Have you seen Carolina? She's out there with Johnny.
Oh, she'll be fine, guys.
- Come on.
- Are you serious?
Yes.
They're probably having sex or something. Oh, you're a funny guy.
Don't be naive.
You didn't notice the chemistry they had?
Hey, guys, listen.
I'm gonna look for her.
I don't know about you.
Just sitting here talking.
Hey, it's dark outside.
Oh, fuck!
Get on the bed. Get onto the bed!
The bed?
Oh, my God.
What is this?
The cab started shaking...
Ran outside, and the sky this just this odd color that I've never seen in my life, and I'm thinking it can't be the show doing this because that's way out of their powers and their control.
What is it?
It's like-- it's like the sky's on fire.
What?
It's like the sky's on fire.
The sky went from dark to light, and it looked like it was on fire, just like Victoria said.
If this is all part of the game, it's beyond me at this point.
I don't understand how they could pull it off.
I feel like I'm on another planet.
I feel like I walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare, and nobody-- nobody has any answers.
I don't have an answer.
I could sit here all day long and just-- it's way above my pay scale.
- Is it moving?
- It just keeps moving.
Carolina never came back today, did she?
Yeah.
Where-- where are they?
She's still in the woods-- the forest.
Well, this can't stop us.
We still have to find her.
We can't leave her out there.
We better go now.
We're just gonna go look for her-- me and Sam, Daniel, Miljan as well.
Oh, my God.
Carolina?
Carolina.
Are you okay?
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Carolina!
- What happened?
Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
Then we see Carolina stumbling towards the girls' cabin, and the girls go rushing over to her.
Are you hurt somewhere?
- What happened?
- Look at all the blood.
What happened?
She's bleeding.
Guys, don't, don't-- don't go to her.
Oh, my God, look at her arm.
Look at her arm.
What happened to you?
You're okay.
Carolina, what happened?
Carolina shows up, and she's battered and disoriented.
She couldn't even speak.
She's trembling.
I don't...
She doesn't remember.
You don't remember?
What do you remember?
She didn't know what was going on.
She was saying she couldn't even, like, remember what she'd been doing out there.
She was just talking nonsense, and it was really jolting to see her come back like that.
_
You were with John?
- And what happened?
- Where is he?
What were you doing with Johnny?
Get her some water.
Get her some help.
Carolina, were you with Johnny?
She said she was.
What were you doing with Johnny?
_
_
She said the name "Johnny."
At that point, I just, you know, lost it.
Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.
For what?
Here, just come here.
Come here.
I want to say something to you.
- What?
- Listen to me!
It's important.
You got to make sure.
You look at his hands.
Okay.
His hands are a tell-tale sign, okay?
His hands will tell you if he did something.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Stay here with the girls.
Stay here with the girls!
I'm not wasting any more time with this guy.
Everyone wants to keep him around, thinking,
"Oh, yeah, he'll turn around and be a good guy."
No, I don't think so.
I'm not gonna lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back.
- She's been through a lot.
- Yeah.
We're gonna look after you, okay?
Don't worry.
We don't know where Johnny is.
Carolina sort of-- she couldn't say much, but she said that she was-- they were fighting-- her and Johnny were fighting.
And then, now she looks like this, so Johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because Sam and Neeko went after him.
Let's just keep moving.
Move. Move.
_
The whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that, you know--
We stop and we look, and there's nothing there.
It's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you're being watched, you know.
Whether, you know, whether you're in the woods or in the cabin, you always feel like something is watching you, and the past two nights, I haven't slept very well, you know.
So I'm just-- you know, you're always looking over your shoulder.
You always think something's there, and, like, the whole thing with the sky now...
I don't know.
Well, he's obviously around here somewhere.
Yes.
You keep saying "he," "he."
Look how thick the brush is here.
If there's somebody around here, we'd see them.
We hear other things.
All of a sudden, something goes flying.
I think we should be talking more in the sense of "what."
I'll go see if the water's boiled.
Thank you.
I don't want to die.
I didn't ever expect that that would be a possibility on this show, and every day that I'm here, I feel like I'm an idiot for staying, that I am gonna end up like Tommy.
I don't deal well with-- Abuse is not something that...
I can handle right now.
I'm scared.
And Johnny was already on the outs with the group for stealing food.
I just-- How could he do that to her?
It didn't make sense.
She's such a nice lady.
Johnny.
Hey. What did you do?
- Huh?
- What did you do to Carolina?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about?
- What'd you do to her?
- I didn't--
She's all cut up and shit.
I don't- - I don't know. I...
What's wrong with you?
I don't know.
I just- - I kind of came to.
I was walking around, and...
I don't know.
I was- - I saw her.
You saw her where?
You got to tell me what happened.
We were in the woods, and...
I don't really-- I don't really remember.
I get approached by Daniel, and basically started accusing me of hurting Carolina.
I didn't know what to say.
What did you to do her?
!
The last thing she remembers is getting in a fight with you, so you can't come back here and tell me that you didn't touch her!
I don't.
Then what happened to her?
I don't know.
That's not a very good answer right now, man.
I don't-- trust me.
Hey.
You hear that?
At the camp.
Let's go.
I don't know.
Are you serious?
You don't know?
You're such a scumbag.
Oh, what?
So she just fell down and ended up that way?
Are you kidding me?
I was in a complete haze.
I had no recollection.
I was like blacked out, like I drank too much.
He doesn't look like he knows what's going on.
I don't.
- Then what happened to her?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
You were together, weren't you?
- You said that.
- Shit!
Neeko!
Neeko!
Guys, he doesn't know!
- Motherfucker!
- Come on! Stop it!
- Stop! Stop it!
- Come on!
Stop it!
Neeko, stop it!
He didn't do it!
Carolina starts screaming, "It's not him.
He didn't do it."
Stop it!
What do you mean?
You said you don't remember.
You said you don't remember.
You're a dead man.
You're a fucking dead man.
Listen. Listen.
Hey, hey.
Hey!
Calm down.
Listen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
Talk to me.
I don't know.
Johnny doesn't know anything?
He doesn't remember anything.
It was just her and him in the forest.
I know that.
I know that.
I saw it in his eyes, okay?
All I remember is I talked to her.
We were arguing.
And then I-I came here, and I started getting accused, and I don't even know what the fuck is going on.
If we caught him in the woods, he would've been dead.
When I saw that look in his eyes, I just felt that I needed to take a step back.
Remember the way she came into camp?
He's got the same look on his face.
Does she remember anything?
Show us your hands.
Oh, yeah.
I've seen that before.
What's that from?
Nothing's making sense here.
And just to be angry and become a bunch of animals--
We can't go killing each other.
We're still human beings.
I don't like things that I can't explain and that I don't have at least some sort of control over.
The sky changing color and looking like fire-- the producers, the show can't do that.
We're talking supernatural stuff now.
Regardless of everything else, that's real, and that scared the hell out of me.
It seems like everybody at camp was convinced that I was the person that hurt her.
I've never hit a woman in my life.
I don't know why I would.
I don't remember anything, but...
I can't say that I didn't 'cause I don't--
I don't know what happened.
But I know in my heart I wouldn't do that.
I don't remember anything.
All I remember is that I was... with--
Went to get Johnny.
He was in the woods.
I found him, and I...
It's all one big blur, like one big blackout.
I have all these marks on my body, and my shirt is broken, and I don't remember.
I don't understand.
So you're telling me this is real.
Yes.
It looks like it's native, handmade.
It looks like it's just a prop to me.
Well, if it's a prop, it's really well-made 'cause you see the barbs.
They're curved.
That's exactly how it should look.
This is ox.
It's real ox.
And it's balanced for throwing.
It just looks perfect.
It's your choice to believe in it or not, but this is real, so...
I don't have to deal with lies in figuring out what is true, what is not.
I have to know the environment I'm in.
I have to know what's out there in order to protect myself and survive.
Look at this.
So, I found this symbol that is really strange.
It has four lines and little triangles on the ends.
Then I found another one and another one, and I realized it's a path.
I should follow them.
At the end, it was very close to the settlement.
I found the last one.
And I found this box.
It was a metal box.
I opened it, and it was a book.
I didn't understand anything because it was in a different language.
I would assume it's Russian because it's cyrillic letters.
In the middle of me looking at it, somebody was watching at me.
It was a person.
He's staring at me.
And he just disappeared in a second.
So there are people out there.
Hey.
I was just gonna try and make things better, and, like, apologize, and just wanted to let her know that I didn't, you know,
I didn't want to screw anything up or make anything awkward for her.
I guess I was in a weird mood, and I just want to apologize because I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything, because I'm really glad you're--
When I realized what Annie's real feelings were for me, I just thought... "I'm sort of open to love in any form right now."
So I kissed her.
Which I kind of surprised myself at, to be honest.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
Hey.
Can I have a seat?
How are you feeling?
I'm okay.
You?
I wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing 'cause I knew she had scratches and stuff on her, and she was sure freaked out like I was.
Do you remember anything from last night?
No.
I don't remember a thing.
I don't remember anything either.
But I know you didn't hurt me.
I would never hurt you.
Can I ask you something, though?
Why'd you set me up?
With the shed and the food?
She couldn't even look me in the eye.
And I was like, "Well..."
I was like, "It tells me all I need to know,"
so I was like-- got the hell out of there.
Johnny.
Johnny.
Stop, please.
Johnny, wait for me.
- Give me a break.
Oh, my God.
- Hey.
I know that.
I know that.
- Johnny.
- I know that.
You're an actress.
She said, like, this slogan.
Like, "I know that. I know that from somewhere."
And then it just-- the light bulb went off.
Yeah, that's like your slogan.
She's that actress from that show that--
I'm like, "That's how I know you."
I didn't want to do that.
I didn't want-
- I asked them.
You didn't want to do what?
I didn't want to burn it down.
I didn't want to set you up.
They told me to.
Who's they?
The producers.
So you're-- you're helping the show?
My Lady.
Don't come towards me!
Episode 17
Young Master.
Arang, back away.
So you've finally come.
I've been waiting so long for you.
Arang!
Jade Emperor's fan is it?
Come out of my mother's body this instant!
What are you planning to do with that?
Didn't you see for yourself that your mother is still in this body?
I saw.
It's because I saw it that I need to resolve this.
Your mother is still in this body!
That's why I'm trying to get my mother's body back!
Dear... dear me.
Did you say your name was Kim Eun Oh?
Kim Eun Oh, You will never get your mother back.
There is one way.
Give your body to me. Then this Magistrate will get his mother back.
What kind of sh*t is this?
The Jade Emperor is done for.
That he could send a little child like you...
Arang!
Arang!
Arang!
You useless punk!
Just hurry back and get her fully recovered.
Arang... are you all right?
Arang, are you all right?
Are you coming to your senses?
Yes.
Good, as for what that woman said earlier, forget it.
You know that makes no sense, don't you?
Magistrate.
Don't say a word and just rest.
Magistrate, you have to listen to me.
I said not to talk.
Earlier, when I saw that woman I remembered something.
The events of that day--I remembered it all.
What?
You remembered?
Then do you know who killed you?
Who was it?
Was it someone we know?
I don't know whether to tell you or not.
What are you talking about?
Arang, who is it?
Who's responsible for doing that to you?
Your....mother.
What?
What did you say?
Your mother...... stabbed me.
What?
What are you saying?
My mother
My mother killed you?
This isn't it.
This can't be possible.
There's no way this is possible.
I had only wished for her not to be dead...
That's why I came this far, looking for her...
What... what is this supposed to mean?
Why on earth?
Why did you allow that monster to reside in your body?
Why on earth...
Mother, what exactly am I supposed to do now?
Please let me live.
Why?
Why are the memories
those erased memories?
Why are they coming back to me?
Young Master.
The Lady is calling for you.
Lee Seo Rim, the truth about your death that you were so earnestly searching for has been revealed.
The one who stabbed me was the Magistrate's mother.
However, she hadn't deliberately tried to kill me.
It's strange.
Could this be all there is to know regarding the true circumstances of my death?
Regarding your questions, you find the answers on your own.
When you've uncovered the truth then I'll ring this bell.
Remember--only the death of the person who led you to your death will ring this bell.
Was it just to find this out that I came this far?
Arang!
I knew you'd be here.
Is your body all right?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
Looking at you like this, it isn't easy.
Should I apologize to you in my mother's stead?
Should I say that I will get vengeance for you and send you to heaven?
Or...
Or ask for forgiveness in place of my mother?
I don't know what I should say to you...
Don't say anything at all.
There's no need.
I've made my decision.
The full moon isn't upon us yet.
There's no way the Jade Emperor would have allowed us to solve this so easily, before the full moon.
Arang ...
There's got to be another truth (more to the truth).
I'm sure there is.
So, don't worry.
Think first about how you can save your mother.
Didn't you say that in your memories, Choi Ju Wal was with my mother?
Yeah.
I need to find out why that guy was with my mother.
What's all this?
He's using private soldiers?
Where did this guy go?
And what are those guys?
Illegal private soldiers and illegal weapons on top of that?
The wily old man...
His scheming is well-planned...
You go that way!
Oh my word!
How could such a thing happen?
She can jump from body to body?
I'm not in a place to speak considering I came back from the dead, but there really are all kinds of strange monsters, aren't there?
So that's why the Magistrate asked about that before.
How did the Magistrate's mother end up in that situation?
No ...
Who exactly is that monster anyway?
I don't know, either.
But you know, she was a really pretty woman.
A woman?
Yeah.
So...isn't there some way to get that girl out of the Magistrate's mother's body?
Aigoo.
I'm not sure...
Then call your ninth-generation ancestor grandmother.
Huh?
!
Uh...how can I call someone who's dead?
It's possible to call them, it's just not easy, is all...
How can you call a dead...
Are you asking me to hold a seance?
That's something even the grand shamans don't find easy.
As you well know, I only have partial psychic talents.
But still, can you try for me, please?
It's fine.
Don't be too scared.
I've been up here multiple times, so I know. Once you get used to it, it will feel as comfortable as your bedroom.
Oh my word...
I think I've been taken in by you again.
Why do I have to go to these extremes?
Hurry up and start.
We need the shirt that the deceased person wore when she was alive.
Hold this in your left hand and put your right hand on your waist.
Then look toward the north.
And say "Miryang, Park MalYun-bok" three times.
"Miryang, Park Mal Yun Bok?"
Yes.
Miryang Park MalYun-bok?
Got it.
Miryang Park Mal Yun-bok!
Miryang Park Mal Yun-bok!
Please!
Please.
Please!
Please ...
Oh! No ...
Don't leave!
Hey!
Grandmother!
Hey, you brat!
Hey, you brat!
Who are you?
Why the h*ll are you calling me?
Great-grandmother? (no specific generation)
That's right.
What did she say?
"That's right, you brat."
Grandmother!
You wench, do you know what you have done?
I did come because you called a seance, but don't do this often. Got that?
It's because it's me that I came so nicely.
Others won't do the same.
What?
What?
Okay, then, why did you call for me?
Is there a way to exorcise another soul from a body?
So you're that wench, Arang.
Rumors about you abound in the other world. They're placing bets.
What?
What?
What is it?
So you would want to go to Heaven?
Heaven?
It's a nice place.
If you go to heaven there's something you need to submit to.
Something that I need to submit to?
You have to leave all of earthly memories behind.
So basically all your current memories will be erased.
Leave my memories?
If something goes wrong, and you end up in hell, the same holds true there.
When you end up at the worst level of hell, as your spirit is destroyed, memories of people cannot survive.
What is she saying?
Aigoo, this useless brat!
Why are you hitting me?
I hit you to improve your hearing.
Why? But still, how could you hit me so hard?
I can hear...
Am I able to hear?
Eh, this little infant...
Okay, so what is it you wanted to ask that you woke me up?
Is there no method for exorcising a soul from another person's body?
It's not precise, but... typically, when the thing that the person considers most precious enters the body, the soul that entered later can be separated.
Right at the moment when that soul is separated, if you stab that later soul with the Jade Emperor's knife, that soul can be destroyed.
but still, it's not anyone who can do the stabbing to make this work.
In any cae, the first thing you need to do is find out what it is that the Magistrate's mother values most.
As for you, take care of yourself. I'm leaving.
Grandmother!
Grandmother!
Grandmother, thank you!
I see that fear has darkened that once bright face of yours.
The memories... why have they come back?
Why do you think it is so?
It's because of you.
If so then..
That's right.
Since I'm unable to feed my spirit, my powers are becoming weaker.
So the revival of your erased memories is really nothing.
Then what do I need to do?
At this rate..
Arang.
Once I posess Arang, all this will come to an end.
Otherwise, nothing you do can help you escape from these circumstances.
Until the day you die, you'll have to carry the memories of those murders, and live as a murderer.
How can this happen...
Why are things like this happening?
Is this.. the punishment for my sins?
I...
What must I do?
Get rid of Kim Eun Oh.
It's because of him that his mother who's in my body keeps trying to get out.
Everytime she makes an attempt I lose so much of my energy.
It's becoming really annoying.
So that guy Kill Kim Eun Oh.
The thing that is most precious to the Magistrate's mother...
The Magistrate probably knows what that is.
What a relief.
This is better than having no method at all.
Arang!
Magistrate!
Magistrate, what's the matter?
I'll call Dol Seo.
No.
It's nothing big.
He'll have a fit if you call him.
But what about this?
Just go into my room and get something to wrap it up with.
Give your body to me.
Then this Magistrate will get his mother back.
What kind of sh*t is this?
The wound is so deep.
What are you doing?
What should I do?
Just wrap it up tightly.
You did it before, didn't you?
What are you thinking about?
That I'm thankful to you.
There are too many things happening all at once.
You, my mother and this place, too.
Only thinking that I was important all my life...
I feel like I'm being punished for that.
How can you say something like that?
Not listening or seeing what others said, that's how I lived my life.
I always thought that each person had to overcome his own pains.
Can someone else do that for you?
But to the person I was back then, why, could I see ghosts that others couldn't see or hear?
I was always angry about that.
But... I changed after I met you.
I was able to understand my mother's pain more clearly.
And then, I was able to see other people's pain too.
Then one day I came to understand
Ah, so that's the way it is.
I am in a position to help those people.
So that's why I'm grateful to you.
No.
It's I,
I haven't done anything for you.
You've done so much for me.
I've never even made you a cup of honey water with my own hands.
The Shaman said, even though you feel like you can't handle the pain of parting ways, but that you'll live on that strength.
Even if you feel like you'll be so bitterly sad to part, but that it's human nature for that sorrow to keep you alive.
That's what becomes love, memories and sentimental longing. That one of those things alone are the strengths that keep you alive.
I by leaving something behind, I thought that would only bring you pain.
Like an idiot.
That's why I pushed your feelings aside and pretended like I didn't know.
I know.
But... those memories can give those left behind strength.
That's what the Shaman said.
I... can't make your body warm.
Or like other people, stay by your side for a long, long time.
Just this, putting on one article of clothing for you.
And, too, as I leave this world I may lose all my memories of you.
But still... I loved you.
Sleep well, Magistrate.
♫ I look for you only... ♫I am looking for the one I long for.
♫The more I look, I want to look for my beautiful beloved whom I'm longing for... ♫ Even yy throat is calling you without restraint...
Even my heart is calling hoarsely... ♫It's only calling your name...
♫I'm picturing you with my tears... ♫You are engraved on my heart... ♫ Even if you are at the end of the world, you are the person who can't be forgotten... ♫Even if I cry a thousand times, The love I long for...
♫ It is you...
Once I possess Arang, everything will come to an end.
That's right.
I will do it according to your will.
And after that... I will do what I want.
I will bring Arang to get rid of my pain and suffering.
And then, I will get rid of you.
Magistrate.
May I come in?
Yeah, sure.
You used to just waltz right in, why ask permission now?
I know, right.
How did it turn out this way?
Last night, there was something I wasn't able to tell you.
I found out a way to get that soul out of your mother's body.
When the thing that the body's owner considers the most precious gets inside the body, the soul that entered later can be separated.
At the moment when that soul is separated, you must stab that soul with Jade Emperor's knife.
Then, the spirit is destroyed.
But it's not just anyone who can successfully wield the knife.
So think carefully, what does your mother consider most dear to her.
And also...
I'm going to meet Young Master Ju Wal.
What?
I'll meet him and ask.
Why he was there that night and what connection he has to your mother.
What happened to your mother.
No, that's my task, so you just stay put.
It's also part of my truth.
Pardon?
What... did you just say?
No... your mother... by a monster was what?
I still don't know for sure what happened.
So keep this to yourself.
Young Master,
Since there was that incident with me, she might have run away.
Initially, we need to capture and imprison her.
I don't really know what is going on, but I'll go and come back.
What's this?
He said she was just here but why isn't anyone here?
What?
It was completely empty?
There wasn't even an ant.
The things you said earlier, was that true?
Although it may be tough, please bear with it for a while.
Fine.
Then I...
It won't take long, right?
Yes.
Lady.
I wanted to meet you so I was waiting in front of your house.
There's something I want to ask.
If it's something about the last time, then I...
No.
I didn't come because of that.
Young Master, just what is it that you are hiding?
What is your connection with that monster?
L...
Lady.
How did that monster get inside the Magistrate's mother's body?
Young Master, you know, don't you?
Young Master.
That person is... a fairy.
Fairy?
That's right.
She has been living in this world, borrowing a human body.
The method of borrowing a person's body... is only possible if the owner of the body allows it.
She grants the body's owner her greatest desire, and receives the owner's body in exchange.
Then... what was it that the Magistrate's mother wanted?
I ... don't know to that extent.
Then, I will meet her and ask her myself.
Lady.
What?
The person who trespassed was the Magistrate?
Yes.
Listening to the description, it seems like it's the Magistrate.
I...
I think I'm going to have to get Geo Deol out.
Although I told him to live a long and lean life, that Magistrate makes me anxious.
Pardon?
What... What would you want to do?
Wake them up. Call all the kids together.
Isn't Lord Choi too late?
Thank you, my Lord.
This will be the last time I'm letting you off.
How can I ever forget your benificence?
For the time being, lay low.
If I need you, I'll call for you.
And watch your behavior.
Yes.
What did you just say?
That Park Geo Deol!
He ran away!
How can a guy in a jail cell get out?
At night, I heard that some guys barged in and got him out
No matter...
Lord Choi is really...
How dare he do that to a prisoner in the government office!
And a murderer at that.
Magistrate, please come out for a while.
What's the matter?
Magistrate, please save my son.
Explain to me what happened slowly.
Lord Choi's soldiers are taking my son away!
Lord Choi's soldiers?
Because I couldn't give Lord Choi's farm rent in time, He took my one and only son to be sold as a slave.
He is being dragged away right now. He is just 8 years old.
What sin did the child commit to be separated from his parents?
Shut up!
They're taking just one boy, but why did they come as a big group?
They are doing that for us to see!
Look at that, shouldn't we be doing something?
If you step forward here and get beaten by them, your whole body would be beaten to pieces, so how would you handle that?
I don't know!
Even if I get emptied of everything, I can't just watch with my two eyes wide open!
Hey you bastards!
What are you doing?
!
Hey, you!
Move!
Magistrate!
Magistrate!
Are you alright?
Aigoo... my child.
Give us that child.
It's Lord Choi's order.
Go and bring the child.
Magistrate, we will never forget this until we die.
We will work hard to repay you.
That's enough, this isn't much.
You can go now.
When our neighbor's child, Sam Wol was sold, I thought it was just some stranger's problem...
I learned that there is no such thing as a "stranger's problem".
Your neighbor's child also suffered the same thing?
It's not just Sam Wol.
In this town, because of the debt with Lord Choi... there isn't just one or two households that are suffering.
Then, we will be going now.
Honestly, saving the child doesn't solve the problem.
Until the debt is paid, they're going to keep getting harassed.
What?
He took the child?
You bastard, I should!
No, wait a minute...
Leebang said that more patrol men were recently hired..
-Kim Seobang!
-Yes, my Lord?
It seems that young bastard is engrossed in playing Magistrate.
Yes, yes...do all you want while you can.
This Magistrate role play will become your karma as it is.
Here, this way.
Make a line, a line.
You can place that here.
Put it down here.
Next!
Over here.
Here, here.
But still...
What should I do, I haven't paid all that debt.
Alright, I get it.
Use up some of your strength!
He looks the same, right?
It's so funny!
Now draw some clothes too!
Hey you brats!
How could you draw...
This won't do.
This is not the time to keep worrying like this.
Now, it's the time for us to make up our minds to choose the line, just like Hyeongbang did.
Geez, how could Hyeongbang choose the line that quickly?
There are so many things to consider.
Lord Choi has his eyes wide open!
Being a simple person can be an advantage in this case.
Is that so?
My head is about to blow.
Old power or new power...?
Who do you think will rise to the top?
You see, this...
I suddenly have this thought.
Are we not missing something here?
That's what I'm saying.
What is it?
It's Miss Arang.
Because of the Magistate and the Lord, we forgot for a moment about Miss Arang.
If we choose the side that Arang chooses,
I have a thought that we will have a smaller chance of failing.
Arang?
Yes.
Lady.
Young Master.
Why are you doing this?
I need to meet that woman and ask her.
Please take me to the place where that woman is.
The reason for you to go this far...
Is it because of the Magistrate?
Then...
I will let you meet her.
It looks like I can't just let you off the hook.
W...
What?
Until now, you had to follow me everywhere like lightning.
You had a hard time, right?
So...
Lets make you into a Chief.
Pardon?
What? !
Patrolmen, listen.
Here, even if Dol Soe is my personal slave, in the meantime he has worked hard in training all of you.
In our government office, to those who does his part to those who have lots of skills and... to those who can be the role models to others, no matter who it is or what position that person is in, I will make sure they take on important tasks within the government office.
Thus. Starting from today, to Dolsoe right here, I appoint him as chief.
Please give him a round of applause.
Chief?
That thing as chief?
Then how do we call him from now on?
Let me see.
Since he doesn't have a last name, do we have to call him Chief Dol?
Bang Ul Ri.
Oh my.
What is it?
How do I look?
It suits me, right?
Young Master told me to wear it from today onwards.
Though I'm not sure if it's alright for him to do this.
Form now on, don't call me Dol Soe.
Call me Chief.
It's sad because I don't have a last name but...call me Chief Dol.
It's Dol SOe cause it's Dol Soe.
But what is Chief Dol?
Why are you like this?
I just like Dol Soe.
This kind of Dol Soe is just so-so.
Hey there, Bang Ul Ri.
What are you doing?
That's what I'm saying.
Why are you like this today?
Are you pouncing on me?
What?
What a nonsense!
What are those?
If I want to take out Moo Yeon from Hong Ryeon's body, I can't do it with only my strength.
Kim Eun Oh... I would need his help.
You can go down now.
As of today, your detention is lifted.
Hey there, what's wrong?
There are so many ghosts around us!
What?
Look, here is now so peaceful...
Chief Dol!
Chief Dol!
Could it be...
The one that Arang Agassi... the Grim Reaper?
Bang Wool was saying about seeing ghosts and such...
Then something suddenly hit me at the back. I fainted right away.
Aigoo...
Dol Soe, go and get some rest.
I'll do so.
What's the matter?
There's a way to save your mother.
What do you mean?
There's a way to save your mother.
What do you mean?
Kim Eun Oh, the child that is inside your mother... she's my sister.
Her name is Moo Yeon.
What?
You can't force her out of your mother's body.
She should come out on her own will.
What's that way?
You will know.
What?
Give Arang's body?
I can't allow that.
I thought your goal... was to save your mother.
We will need to join our strengths together, Kim Eun Oh.
That way you would be able to save your mother,
And I would be able to save my sister.
Don't say things that make me laugh.
Don't say nonsense such as there's no other way than using Arang.
Find a real way. Then I will be your ally a thousand, even ten thousand times.
Even when I was stuck on the floor in the dark inside of me, there was love.
I was once a human...
That love I always laughed at... also once dominated me...
When we were lovers, we longed for each other crazily, but... we couldn't have happiness.
Because our fates were so deep, we reincarnated as siblings.
Time changed and even as our names changed,
Ilovedmy Brother.
Even as we met as a Grim Reaper and Heaven's Fairy, I loved him just like before.
I didn't like living in Heaven.
Since I can't have love in Heaven
I told him to return back as humans because I found out the way to go back, but you refused.
That's why if you're in the dark for a long time, you forget what you were looking at in the beginning, and when everything became dark, it's not love nor obsession nor desire, it just became the evil monster itself.
That's why humans are weak in several aspects.
This is the place.
Thank you.
Even if I told the Lady to do according to what she wants...
I will go in now.
Don't listen to anything that woman says.
What...is this sound?
Criminal, Kim Eun Oh, come out now and receive this order.
What?
What's wrong?
Drag him out!
Yes!
Welcome.
What's wrong?
Why?
Let me go!
What's this?
You bastards!
Let me go!
Arang and the Magistrate Preview
You arrogant bastard.
You won't be able to do anything.
Just like your foolish mother couldn't.
Lord Choi!
Young Master, why on earth are you with that woman?
Daring b**ch.
She is harder to get than I expected.
Help me, Brother.
Help me.
She's here.
What did the Magistrate's mother want in return for her body?
What would you want so that you would give your body?
To protect the people precious to you?
I...

- [snoring] - Po.
Po! - Huh?
Oh, sorry, master shifu.
It's just so comfy up here.
[groans] - All right, back to training.
- Whoa!
[all grunting] Master shifu, we spend hours every day Training our--[grunts] off.
And why?
- Because you are all that stands Between the innocent and evil.
- But we kick evil's-- [groans].
Good one.
Seriously, our kung fu skills are way past overkill.
- He's got a point.
- [grunts] No, we can't slack off on training.
You never know when some giant fiendish beast Will strike at us with its horrible fanged tentacles.
- Have another bad dream?
[groans] - none of your business.
- Ow.
- True warriors must always be at their peak.
- But, dude!
I mean, "master dude."
No one we ever fight is even a challenge anymore.
We can beat all the bad guys with just our pinky fingers.
- That, po, is a woeful exaggeration.
- There's trouble in the village!
- This is why you have to keep your kung fu in top shape.
Who knows how serious this could--
- It's the croc bandits!
- And never mind.
- Puny shopkeeper, tremble in fear As we forcibly redistribute your wealth in our direction.
- Eh, no.
- No?
- No.
Can I interest you in some bitter melons?
Two yuan a dozen.
- Ooh.
[smacks] - I don't think you understand how this works, guy.
We're bandits and we're robbing you.
- I understand how it would work If you were real bandits, But you're a joke.
So how it actually works is... Buy something or get out!
- Darn it!
Are we crocodiles or are we-- What are those things that are like crocodiles But smaller?
- Uh, dwarf crocodiles? - [smacks lips]
- Just attack that guy!
- [clears throat] - Gah...
- Okay, here's where I prove my point.
- [sighs] - Furious five, pinkies out.
- Oh, this is just dumb.
- And I don't have pinkies.
- Me neither.
- Oh, forget it.
By myself, pinkies only. And go!
- [sighs] - Showboat.
- [groans] - Eh?
[punches landing, groaning] - This is all just so sad.
- Huh?
Eh?
So have I made my point, Or do I have to beat them again with just one pinky?
- Hey, wait.
Aren't you gonna--
Wow, they didn't even bother to arrest us.
- This is all just so sad.
Here.
Here's a few yuan to tide you over.
- Master shifu.
How awesome was I in there, huh?
If anything, I may have been a bit too awesome.
But honestly, sometimes I just can't control How awesome I be, so--
- Do you think you don't need to train so much?
Do you?
[sighs]
Fine. As of now, po is in charge of training.
- No way.
- Yay.
- Good luck with that.
- We are not going to seriously go through with this, are we?
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- [giggles] - That's exactly what I'm afraid of.
- Well, we just made more in pity money Than we made in the last three months of banditry.
Do you know what that means?
That means we are officially beggars.
There's gotta be someone we can rob. [footsteps]
Mah-jongg.
Ha ha! All right, old guy, Hand over your money and you won't get hurt.
- Or you could hand over your money And ywon't get hurt.
[laughter] - Are you, like, trick or treating, guy?
You're smaller than my head.
[laughter] - [mocking gibberish] - Then I guess you have nothing to fear, hm?
- [groans] - Thank you.
We'll consider this payment for your training.
- Training?
- Do you enjoy being beaten by po and the furious five Again, and again, and again, and again, and again, And again, and again?
- No, sir.
It stinks, sir.
- Then your training begins now.
- [groans] - That was lesson one.
I am master jia, And you are going to hate training with me.
- You are going to love training with me.
Ta-da!
- I am not doing this.
- Shifu said I'm in charge, ♪ so you gotta do what I say ♪ [swing creaking]
- Yes!
All right, it's time to try out Our new kung fu skills.
Now I don't want you guys getting cocky, all right?
We'll rob someone easy.
- [whimpers] - Oh, no, you didn't.
- You got a problem?
- I don't have a problem.
I am a problem.
Your problem, that you have.
- I heard of you guys.
They say you're total wimps.
- That's what they say?
- Croc bandits, take care of these lowlifes.
- Let's get out of here.
- [whimpering] - Go home to your mama And tell her your kung fu is subpar.
[whimpers] - [laughs] Okay, guy, hand over all your--
- Thanks for saving me from those bandits.
Here's your reward.
[cheers and applause]
- That was awesome!
- Oh.
You know, I could get used to this.
[cheers and applause] - They saved us!
Oh, yes!
- All right, one side, make way.
You guys again?
Fine, my pinkies could use a workout.
- But the crocs weren't--
- Don't trouble yourself, sir.
We'll handle this.
What the hey?
Yah. Ow.
Ow!
Whoa, it looks like you've been training.
- Looks like you haven't.
- We've been training.
- How is a pie-eating contest training?
- Because it-- be--rah--
We challenge you to a pie-eating... Contest.
No?
Ooh! - Stop.
These crocs are heroes, And you come along and start beating on them?
- Sh-yeah, beating' on our fists with their faces.
- You call yourselves masters. - Yeah!
[crowd jeering]
- Uh, well, a honest mistake. [chuckles]
Right, so we'll just be heading out then.
- I think that would be best, guy.
- Here.
[laughter and cheering] - So how do you like being a hero, fung?
- I like it a lot, gah-ri.
I like it a lot.
[groaning] - So things went weird with, you know, bandit-ing. But it was actually kinda cool.
[groans] It's like we were the good guys.
- Perhaps you have at last Discovered your true destiny.
- Nah, but we finally found out What we're really supposed to be doing.
- The point is:
Maybe there's more Than one way to defeat the furious five.
- Like, beat them--like, be better good guys than them?
Oh!
Oh, that would be so boss.
- Take this.
The next time you see the one they call "shifu,"
Present it to him.
[groaning] - Help!
Help!
- [groans] - Huh?
I don't understand it.
Those guys get everywhere before us.
And all of a sudden, they're, like, good and junk.
I mean, they're good guys, And they're also, like, good at kung fu.
- Is that so?
Tell me, how is your training going?
- Uh, monkey ate six pies?
- Uh-huh.
Obviously, the crocs have been training.
There's only one master who could teach them
So much so quickly: Master jia.
He is one of the great kung fu masters of china.
But greater even than his fighting skill Is his belief in the power of training.
He travels the land, accepting only those pupils Who are willing to commit themselves fully To his training regimen.
[bowl shatters] The reward for their hard work: Those who train with master jia
- So you think the crocs Have been training with this master jia?
- I would stake my reputation on it.
- And you're saying that the way to be better than the crocs
Is to train really, really hard? - Exactly.
- I--yea--nahhh.
- [sighs] - Noodles, soup, dumplings.
- We're here for the money, old man.
- Oh, really?
Loyal customers? - Not so fast.
- Fung?
- Oh, hey, lumpy.
- So is it true you're, like, a good guy now?
- Yeah. [chuckles]
It's a funny old world.
[bird chirps] Oh, okay.
So now's, like, when we fight.
- [sighs] uh... [groaning] [pants nervously]
[both pant nervously]
- [screams] [both scream] [both pant nervously] - It's you guys!
- I was full-on gonna say the exact same thing.
- What are you guys doing here?
- Um, saving your dad's noodle shop.
What are you doing here?
- That too!
- Well, we already saved it, so tough turkey.
- You can't-- look, look.
We're the heroes around here.
- Are not.
- Are too.
- Are not.
- Are too!
- Hey, while you heroes were arguing, Those guys robbed me.
- You let them get away.
- We totally had it handled before you got here, pal.
- It's true, son.
You did ruin everything.
- Thanks, dad.
Thanks for that.
- Look at them.
The furious five are old and played out.
- You say that after all we've done for this village?
- You named a well after me.
[droplet drips] - Look, you guys were great, But maybe it's time to make way for someone
Who can still do the job. - Ridiculous.
Maybe the furious five aren't quite at their peak,
But that's no reason to-- - oh, there you are.
Like, I'm supposed to give this to you.
- Oh, no.
- What is it?
- It's a letter from the emperor himself.
He sent jia to train your replacements.
- Wait, what?
- The crocs are the new furious five.
My friends, we have been fired.
- [gasps] no!
- Whoo-hoo!
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was insensitive.
[whispering] whoo-hoo.
- We're fired?
- So we can, like, move into the jade palace?
- That can't be right.
- The jade palace is our home.
- Not anymore.
Now it's the crocs' home.
- But they can't--
- This is the emperor's official seal.
To disobey would be treason.
- On the plus side, we've totally been living In the bamboo forest, so at least It's a step up for someone, right?
[laughs] right?
Okay, we'll have your stuff boxed up and sent to you.
Ciao! Mwah.
- Whoo-hoo!
- It has been an honor to work with you, But nothing lasts forever.
Good-bye.
- This is...
- All my fault.
- All your-- well, now it's no fun.
- I know it's my fault.
But maybe it's not too late to fix it.
- Of course it's too late.
That scroll says the crocs are the new furious five!
- Hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, Hold on, hold on!
- Holding.
- It says master jia is commanded To train the replacements for the furious five.
He trained the crocs, but that doesn't mean He can't train the replacements for them too!
Master jia?
Hello?
Olly olly oxen free!
Jia, jia, jia, jia, jia!
[groans] That's it, I give up.
We're never gonna...
What?
Aah! Wow, you're really small.
Master jia, I presume? - Yes.
And you must be the one they call "po."
[groans] - Lesson one: Never drop your guard.
- So you'll train us?
- If I do, this will be the most intense, arduous, And painful training you have ever experienced.
- Boo-ya!
- Oh.
I, uh--I didn't realize.
That sounds kind of, uh... [sighs] we're in.
- Hah! Ow...
- Aw, this is the life, huh?
Food, shelter, lots of ancient weapons, Custom tile and junk.
- There's trouble in the village!
- [groans] what is it now?
- Bandits are robbing ying the grocer.
- Ah.
Hm, hm, hm. Well, according to my records, Ying failed to make his protection payment this week,
So the dude is up a xiaoxi without a duanjiang. - The old furious five never charged people, you know?
- Yeah, faulty business model.
[all grunting] - You have trained well, my pupils.
- Even me?
- Yes, po.
Although perhaps with a little more crying than the others.
- Dad says that's my special gift.
- Come with me.
- Where are we going, master jia?
- If you want the jade palace back, You'll have to prove you're more worthy of it Than the crocs are.
- They're back.
They're back!
Where have you been?
- The crocs charge money to protect us!
- They take our goods whenever they feel like it.
- They eat raw onions.
- So you're saying you miss us?
- Yes, we do.
[overlapping agreements]
- Well, if it isn't the spurious five.
That means "fake." - fung.
They are here to challenge you for the jade palace.
- So be it.
I can't help but notice you guys have been training.
- Thanks.
- [groans] - And I can't help but notice That you guys haven't.
- Well, we've been busy with all the graft And corruption, and the like.
- Ah... - You have to make time for training, fung.
True warriors must always be at their peak.
- But it's so--[groans] hard.
- [grunting] training may be hard, But it's not as hard as this!
- [groans] - See, guys, I used to think training Was something you did until your kung fu was good enough.
Now, I see that kung fu is training.
It's something you have to live every day.
- Well said, panda.
Well said.
- Thank you very-- wait, what?
- Shifu?
- Really?
- No way.
- Should've seen that coming.
- [gasps] - I feel used, guy.
- Po, I had to go to some extremes, But I think I may have finally gotten you To understand the true importance of training.
- You sure have, master shifu. [chuckles]
- Good, so-- - that's why I'm glad
We just did a whole bunch of it So we can take a break for a while.
Whoo!
Who wants a nap?
- Me!
- I'll take two!
- [sighs]
- [GUNSHOT] - NARRATOR: Previously on...
I'm doing this pretty big pilot.
Writing, directing, producing, starring in.
Don't even think about putting me on the call sheet if you're gonna have Wallace Fennel doing any of that pussy shit.
Ryan, baby, can I be in it?
Uh, where do you think you're gonna find an Asian guy who's gonna let you beat him up?
- Uh, 28.22.
- What's that?
Oh! It's the Ghost of Beaver Past, son!
Oh, I'm always happy to lend a hand, or voice, in my case, when it's a special project and a dear friend is at the helm.
I mean, look around.
This is a labor of love for everyone involved.
Okay, does that about do it?
You know, I'd like to try one more, if that's okay.
Um, this time really hit the words "special" and "dear."
You know, special project for my dear friend.
Ok, maybe this time you can just riff a little bit about how I inspire you as a performer and a human being.
Okay, you have got all of my scripted dialogue plus about ten takes of that making-of bullshit, you fuzzy little prick, and that is all you get.
Ooh, I can feel the vibrations from your throaty timbre deep within my loins.
[DEEP VOICE] I bet the ladies love it.
Your mother did.
Voice-over actors, man. I'm telling you.
They're so high maintenance.
Let me let you in on a little secret.
It's just talking.
A total boob could do it.
DICK: First Weevil, then Keith.
Danger now lurks around every corner, but so do I.
All I wanted was a nice weekend of sun and fun at my buddy's funeral.
But now death followed me around like a hungry dog.
And that dog wasn't the only thing looking for a bone.
DICK: I guess what they say is true.
No lock in the world could keep a thirsty chick from a tall drink of water.
Is that what they say?
They do now.
Got a name?
- Yes.
It...
- It doesn't matter.
- Can I ask you a question?
- You just did.
Ask me another one.
People everywhere are dying to the left and to the right.
The killer is still out there, but you remain as cool as a cucumber.
I didn't hear a question.
How do you do it, Dick Casablancas?
Oh, you're about to find out.
DICK: Some may say it's crass to take advantage of an emotionally vulnerable woman.
But those people are probably ugly.
What I just performed was a public service, like picking up trash at the beach or not farting on an airplane.
This was grief counseling, Dick-style.
And what about my grief?
If you prick me, do I not bleed?
Scratch that.
I ain't got time to bleed.
BEAVER: Covering all the angles, aren't you?
Oh, yeah, she's super flexible.
Don't you worry, bro.
This case-solving factory, it's running 24-7, okay?
I'm gonna find your killer.
I heard about Keith Mars. That's a shame.
Wait, is he, um... ?
Down... ?
No, no. He's...
But, you know, you hear things.
- Hear anything about Duncan? - Mm-mm.
You know, I'm starting to wonder if his death was accidental after all.
He's the sole heir to Kane Software's 3D printing patents, worth billions.
That's something I call motive.
Makes sense to me.
Do you have any suspects?
Negative.
Totally stumped.
I can't think of anyone who would want
Duncan, Weevil and Keith all dead.
Well, every case is a puzzle, Dick, but with the top of the box missing.
No picture of what it's supposed to look like to guide you.
You just have to figure out how to put it together one piece at a time.
Truth, bro, but time... that's exactly what I'm running out of.
Well, what's the fastest way to solve a puzzle quickly?
Start with the corners.
You ask a friend for help.
Ask a friend. Mm.
Veronica, Richard.
Looking good.
I assume.
Hey, I hate to bother you at a time like this, but, um,
I need your help.
I'm at Duncan's memorial service weekend getaway thing and...
Well, you know what, just get here as soon as you can.
Oh, and, uh, sorry about your dad and all.
Estos tacos son mortales!
Yes, I hired a dialect coach for my Mexican lines.
I just think it's really important, especially in television, to respectfully represent other cultures.
It's gonna take more than a knife to slow me down.
Yeah, like a gun.
Yeah, a gun would probably do it.
[DUBBED IN DEEP VOICE] Then you'd better saddle up, cowboy.
This is your last ride.
You are not without skill.
- Where did you study your craft?
- The Streets.
That was the name of my dojo I went to.
It was in the strip mall by my high school.
Allow me to impart another lesson!
You fight honorably, Dick-san.
But I fight to win.
Oh! What is that? Ah!
No. Hyah!
Why'd you kill Duncan, Weevil and Keith?
- Huh? - I...
Oh! I...
Who do you work for?
I work for... Ow!
Who sent you?
Spondoolie.
Who's behind this, Wiedman?
Y... you know.
You've always known.
No, I don't know.
That's why I'm punching you out.
Wait.
No.
- Veronica.
- You're too late.
She's already dead.
Because you brought her here.
Do it.
Do it.
Do it!
Uhh! Do it.
Do it.
No.
You're not even worth it.
So, Christopher, were you excited when, uh, Ryan asked you to be a part of this?
Who's Ryan?
MAN: Ryan Hansen.
The director.
The guy you did your death scene with?
Ah.
You know what?
I've been in this game a while.
I've played presidents, cops, villains, you name it.
I was on Walker, Texas Ranger.
It's a job.
I show up, I do the work, collect a check.
MAN: Except here.
The check part I mean.
Come again?
MAN: Well, nobody's getting paid.
It's a microbudget.
Veronica Mars.
Just who I was looking for.
I'm just here for Dick.
I bet you are.
But you'll have to settle for this.
Are you okay?
I think so.
Recognize, bitch.
Do you know what time it is?
It's about motherfucking time, that's what time it is.
Get your ass some Wallace!
Yeah!
- [GUNSHOT] - NARRATOR: Previously on...
- Veronica.
- You're too late.
- I'm just here for Dick.
- I bet you are.
But you'll have to settle for this!
- Are you okay?
- I think so.
Recognize, bitch.
Oh, my God, Wallace.
You just shot Madison.
To the untrained eye, perhaps.
That's not Madison.
This is Celeste Kane, wife of Jake Kane, mother of Duncan Kane, whose funeral we were at today.
And, oh, my God. She's the mystery woman.
How'd you know?
Three words.
Contour of vagina.
I know Madison's like the palm of my hand.
Add that to Kane Software's 3D technology...
Heh. What did you tell me?
We've only scratched the surface of what these machines can do.
Face masks so perfect... can fool almost anyone.
Suddenly, pieces have fallen into place.
Powers of de-Dick-tion.
What?
Wow, Dick, I never ever could've put all that together.
That's okay.
You know what?
Someday you will get there.
But you are adorable, and that counts for something.
And as for you, now this is the time where you confess and tell us why you did it.
Because they ruined my life!
Weevil sullied my daughter.
Keith, he accused my husband of murder.
And Veronica, she spirited away my little Duncan.
They all deserved to die, and I would've gotten away with it
- if it hadn't been for...
- Us meddling kids?
I already said.
- Vagina contour.
- No. This black kid.
- Bitch.
- That's no black kid.
Whitey say what?
You're no killer, old friend.
No. Please. Don't.
Anybody want a donut?
- [GASPS] - Duncan Kane.
Extraordinary.
Duncan.
Is that really you?
In the flesh.
Don't hate me.
My prodigal son.
Duncan must've figured out that his mom was planning his fake funeral so that she could gather all of her old enemies there so that she could murder them.
He then flew back from Australia so he could save Veronica's life.
Way ahead of you, Ace.
Hello, old friend.
Yeah, I know it's a little bit of a strange choice for Mercer the serial rapist from season three to be recast as Duncan Kane from seasons one and two.
Normally that kind of thing would bump me as an actor, but...
I just got to make out with Veronica Mars!
I can't believe this shit.
My own son shot me.
Pipe down, Mom.
I winged you.
You'll live.
Why did he go through the trouble to look like Wallace?
He needed a fall guy.
The police are picking up the real Wallace as we speak.
- Airtight plan.
- Yeah, again, though, I've been shot.
So if somebody could call an ambulance...
I don't know, maybe help - slow the bleeding.
- You're not gonna stand in the way of our love again, Mom!
Don't you get it?
I'm not your perfect son.
I never was!
Veronica, you said you wanted to take some time for your career...
- [BOTH MOANING] - Yeah.
Right on.
Well, my work here is done.
Ay-oh! Spondoolie.
Go, Dick! Go, Dick!
It's almost like it's too good, right?
Micro-budget just gave you a macro boner, am I right?
- So, Ryan...
- Yes.
I... I'm afraid it's gonna be a pass.
Yeah, look, our demo, you know, they're, uh, they're... they're a bit more accustomed to, um... you know, a certain level of...
Competence.
You know, Jeanie in reception can give you partial validation.
No, she can't, Thom.
I parked on the street.
You know, I took your one note.
No smart pills.
That's what ruined it.
A couple of smart pills could've saved this project.
You might be right, Ryan.
So... just so you know...
- MAN: Nice to see you.
- You too.
I'll admit it.
Yeah, I was a little choked when the CW passed, but turns out they're not the only pretty girl at the party.
Yeah, their loss was my gain.
Gave the footage to my agency, they shopped it around...
Guess what?
- Dick's gone global. - [GUNSHOT]
They say you can't win 'em all...
They don't know Dick.
Hand.
[♪ ♪ ♪]
Good morning.
Please, have some.
You wrote all this for the Romans?
Battles, sieges, wars.
I write the stories that I'm told.
But your stories must please your masters.
Or what will they do?
Behead you?
Crucify you?
Sit down.
You say I'm a traitor, but which of us is master of their destiny?
Who is free... and who is in chains?
You tell me.
Never forget, you are my prisoners.
Until I hear the full story, you will remain so.
I don't think you've slept well, I can tell.
Was it a dream, perhaps?
A lion?
Yes.
And a snake.
A giant snake.
Yes, well, the snake would be Rome, would it not?
Hissing, waiting to devour the lion.
They were camped below us... an insult every time we looked over the wall.
I used to think we could see heaven from Masada.
But all I saw were the gates of hell.
We were only a few hundred.
If their empire was so great, why did they have to cross the desert to destroy us?
Well, Masada was an ember that could ignite the flames of rebellion in other places.
It had to be crushed.
So... let us begin.
Report.
By sundown, both camps will be set up.
The full contingent arrives by the end of the day tomorrow.
The scouts say there are only two ways up.
The serpent's path up the side, how is it?
Too steep and narrow to support any troops or equipment.
What about the cliffs on the back of the mountain?
You would need ropes to climb up that way.
They'll pick us off like sparrows.
How long do you think they can last?
It is rumored they have plenty of oil and grain in their storerooms, left over from the time of King Herod.
We, on the other hand, will need to feed thousands of mouths every day.
And for water?
They have a network of cisterns that are replenished every time there is a flash flood.
Starving them out would take years.
We're not waiting for them to starve, Claudius.
We're going to go up there and get them.
No one's ever done that before, not in the hundred years since it was built.
Block every exit.
I want guards posted to bar any passage through the ravines.
They must have nowhere to run.
You're going to force them to take a stand.
The best way to catch a scorpion is to crush it in its own garden, no?
The Sicarii say this mountain is invisible.
They believe their God pulled a curtain over it.
They were wrong.
How many are up there?
Stay away from the walls!
Do not let them count our numbers!
Let them think we have thousands of warriors!
Gather a few men.
Let's see what the pig eaters are up to.
My love!
My love. The warriors need your help.
They do?
Can you make more of these?
We're running short.
My angel, my dove. Thank you.
Thank you!
The man from the valley.
Yes.
His name was Yoav.
An air of mystery surrounded him.
He never spoke, yet his eyes held a deep sorrow.
I never knew how Yoav's fate would be bound to mine.
As yours was to Eleazar?
Eleazar and I were bound to each other steel to steel.
Have you ever known that kind of love?
I'll see you tonight.
I'm sorry. You can't come in.
I-I don't understand.
Why are we treating him like this?
I can't let you in.
He's locked in a cage like an animal.
- What is happening?
- What has he done to us?
They've had the slave locked up in there
- since he tried to escape.
- You can't do this to him.
I have to see him.
This is my fault.
I will not let him die alone.
Eleazar is still scouting with the warriors.
Who else can give permission?
Maybe his wife, Channa.
Yes.
Yes, I will go to her.
- I don't think that is wise.
- Why not?
Because she will see that you're too close to him and she won't help you.
You know her?
Since before you were born.
Oh. Then I'll go.
I have seen her watch the children play.
Take L'viyah with you.
No one can resist her smile.
Whatever you do, Aziza, please be careful with her.
Yes?
- I have a favor to ask of you.
- Go away.
Please.
Please.
It's for my friend.
She takes pity on the slave.
I can't help you.
Perhaps I have something for you.
A potion to help with your breathing.
No one can help me.
Thousands of them.
The entire Tenth Legion.
And many slaves.
To build their camps.
More camps?
Five.
Six.
Maybe more.
All around the mountain.
Go back to the Snake Path.
You and Uri, come with me.
Hold this for me.
Aziza... she must put a flame to it and breathe in the smoke.
It will help her instantly.
Do not let the fire flame too brightly or she may never breathe again.
I pity her.
Leave her with us.
You didn't bring the baby?
No.
I'll arrange for one visit for your friend.
Tell the witch I say thank you... for allowing me to breathe.
Ewn?
Gareth?
Can you hear me, brothers?
Do you hear me?
Yes, yes, I hear you.
I hear you.
I hear you.
Yael.
It's okay.
They treat him worse than a dog.
I can't leave him like that.
The least I can do is bring him food and water
Did she say anything about me?
Yes, she sent her gratitude.
Her gratitude is a curse.
I need an hour, no more.
Well, I'd have to bring the baby with me this time.
Otherwise, she won't do anything.
Yael, she's a demon.
Where was Eleazar during this time?
What was he doing?
He came back from the expedition and had seen the vastness of the Roman army.
He should have known then that surrender was your only option.
Eleazar believed Masada would be our salvation.
He was our leader.
His words lifted our hearts and gave us courage.
We believed we could overcome the demons camped at our feet.
Flavius Silva had thousands of fighting men.
You had only a few hundred.
That may be true... but we believed God was on the side of the innocent.
God is never on the side of the innocent.
God is on the side of the one that has the most weapons.
When the fortress of Machareus fell to the Tenth Legion, under the command of Flavius Silva, the very same one who's surrounding us now, he promised freedom in exchange for surrender.
He lied.
When our brothers surrendered,
Flavius Silva ordered every man slaughtered and every woman violated.
They then took the women and children and threw them on pyres and burned them!
Masada is the last Jewish fortress standing in Judea.
We have wine, oil and plenty of food left.
Our cisterns are full.
We can wait for them to tire and move on.
But hear this.
Whatever happens, there'll be no retreat for Masada!
Baruch hashem!
Baruch hashem!
Freedom or death!
Freedom or death!
- Freedom or death!
- Freedom or death!
Freedom or death!
Baruch hashem!
Baruch hashem!
You don't shout with us, brother.
Do you not believe in our fight for freedom, or are you too afraid to die?
I'm already dead.
My dearest.
My love.
My little lamb.
You will sleep with me on a bed of silk.
Fetch the baby tomorrow.
But his mother is waiting for him.
Does your friend want to visit the slave again, or does she not?
You are beautiful.
I look terrible.
I love your tears.
Now cry some more so that I can kiss them away.
I have to go get L'viyah.
I will be back, I promise.
I promise.
Channa?
Channa, it is I, L'viyah's mother.
She's better off with me.
I will take care of her.
Channa?
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
She's barren.
She'll never give the baby back.
Can you talk to Eleazar?
- No, I cannot.
- You know him.
I saw you together.
I'm sorry.
I'll go.
I've come to get the child.
Her mother wants her back.
I didn't know she had a mother.
Who's the father?
Not everyone has a father, Eleazar.
Everyone has that.
Wait here.
You need to give the baby back to her mother.
She is mine now.
No.
Please.
Don't take her.
Don't... take her.
Thank you.
We tried to ignore the world appearing below us.
Camps were built overnight.
Tents rising so quickly, they seemed to come into being before our very eyes.
I'm sure your people were feeling the... the threat mounting.
Yes.
Fear was starting to take hold.
This is always the time when people turn against each other.
And you,
Witch of Moab... you would have been the perfect target for people wanting to blame someone.
People wanted flesh and blood to turn against.
Channa eagerly knew where to point the finger.
She took her revenge.
She turned the people against me.
She's a witch!
She's a witch!
Kill her!
Kill her!
So this is your doing?
This is your revenge?
You witch!
You will not have my husband!
I've had him all along!
Kill the witch!
No!
Let me go!
Stop it!
Out of the way!
Let her go!
Set our sister free!
Yahweh!
Our spirits are dry!
Mayim! Mayim, mayim, mayim!
Yahweh, open up the sky!
Heal us!
Drench us with your geshem.
Amen!
Amen Selah!
Yahweh!
Yahweh!
Hear our supplication!
How long...
Mayim!
Did you really believe that you made it rain all by yourself, Witch of Moab?
That power is from God.
From love.
I was merely an instrument.
Does that frighten you at all?
Of course.
My mother warned me.
Love would be my undoing.
I don't understand.
Love makes you give yourself away.
It binds you to another person's fate, like I was bound to Eleazar.
When I saw Aziza and Amram, I feared he would lead her to her ruin.
Why are you saying that?
He will tempt you with the path you must not travel.
I have seen your destruction, Aziza.
I want to protect you from love.
So we must all stay away from love?
This is the fate of all your children?
It is me.
Whomever I loved would be doomed.
And Eleazar?
You didn't want to love him?
You took him away from his wife.
We had no choice.
I curse what it is to be a woman.
Is that why you made me live as a boy?
Tell me, Immah.
You owe this to me now.
They were bandits.
They found us unprotected.
A woman and a child, alone.
What they did to me... they also did to you.
Do you understand,
Aziza?
Sa'adollos loved you.
And when he saw what they had done, he was like a demon from another world.
He killed each one of the bandits.
I vowed no one would ever hurt you like that again.
And so I changed your name and decided you would be a boy.
To save you from the fate of women.
When you change your name... you change your fate.
Your name had been Rebekah.
But now you were Aziza, one who is mighty.
From then on, you were a boy.
I want to be a warrior again.
I am that person, Immah.
Let me be who I am.
I don't want to lose you, child.
You are my heart.
I shall be a warrior again.
That is my fate.
And you cannot change it.
Amram!
Amram!
Uri, calm down.
- What did you see?
- Roman convoy.
- Where?
- Up in the ravine.
How many soldiers?
About 30 or 40 soldiers.
- 12 carts.
- Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I saw them up in the ravine.
What is it?
Uri spotted Roman carts in the ravine heading towards the first camp.
It's their line of supply coming from the Salt Sea.
I'm sure there's another one coming from Jerusalem, too.
They have thousands of mouths to feed every day.
We should attack the convoy, cut off their supply.
Yes.
Go.
Let them think demons stole their supply.
Brothers,
- gather your weapons. - Amram, Amram, I want to go.
Please.
Adir, you're not ready yet and your mother would kill me.
Maybe next time. Brothers, hurry!
Come on!
My mother gave me this.
Spell book.
Secret recipes passed down from her mother and her mother before.
A cure for night blindness.
Headache.
To catch a thief.
The leaf of a date palm is the cure for a scorpion bite.
Be careful with that one.
Just a few drops of it will make any strong man completely powerless.
Mix it with water, and it is deadly.
What are you going to do?
About your slave.
I cannot let him be a prisoner, but I don't want to lose him.
Well, if you wait too long to decide, you will lose him anyway.
They will kill him.
Immah, where is Adir?
He's resting.
He's not in there.
Take three men, approach from the rear.
Make a lot of noise when you are in position.
When they go after you, we'll take them from the front.
Join us then.
Adir?
What are you doing here?
Go back.
- Go back!
- I want to fight. Please!
Please, Amram!
- Please!
- Shh!
Be quiet.
And stay behind me.
When I cut a pig eater, make sure he doesn't rise again.
- Yes! - Shh!
Quiet.
Quiet.
Go now, my brother.
May God protect you.
What's that?
Go and see what's happening!
Where are they?
!
Come on!
Gather the dead.
Take whatever you can carry and burn the rest.
Adir!
Adir.
You did good.
Adir, you did good.
You are one of us now.
Let's go back up.
Adir!
He followed us.
I tried to send him back.
Adir!
How dare you?
Get out!
Get out!
Adir.
Stay calm.
Stay calm.
Adir.
Go get some water.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Yael, hurry!
Water!
Shh.
We have to burn his garments, so the demons can't enter him.
Burn his garments so the demons can't enter him?
The threat wasn't coming from demons, it was coming from real men.
The Roman army waiting down below.
What were the men doing?
Sleeping?
Only 15 dead and three carts destroyed, General.
What was in the carts?
Barrels of wine... and the-the oysters you ordered from Corsa.
I will make those Jews drink the blood of their children.
Accelerate the building of the siege wall.
We can't possibly go any faster, General.
The slaves are dying like flies in this heat.
What are slaves for but to die?
Get a siege tower started now.
Tower?
The fortress is over a thousand feet high.
There's no tower that can poss...
To destroy them we have to reach them.
And I shall reach those walls even if I have to build a tower tall enough to touch the sky.
Adir's leg doesn't look good.
I don't think he'll be able to go with the warriors.
All warriors must go when called;
Adir's one of us now.
Amram, he can't even walk without a crutch.
You and your mother, you baby him too much.
Is something wrong?
Don't trouble yourself with such things.
Tell Adir I'll need him soon.
Adir.
How do I look?
Like me.
A bit smaller, maybe.
It'll be our secret.
I'll make you proud, Adir.
I promise.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.
Just when I was getting used to you being a girl, and now you're a boy again.
Think you can use this?
Who do you think I am?
A girl?
Tonight we go behind the Roman lines.
They won't be expecting us so soon.
Let us show them that we have no fear.
Let us show them that God is with us.
Brothers, many of us will fall tonight.
We take no prisoners.
Baruch hashem.
Baruch hashem!
- Freedom or death!
- Freedom or death!
Freedom or death!
Freedom or death!
Freedom or death!
Freedom or death!
Did you even try to stop her?
What was Shirah supposed to do?
Send her injured son or her daughter who was a warrior?
It was not my choice anymore.
It was hers.
No!
You did well tonight.
A real warrior.
Please don't say anything.
Warrior's promise.
And walk beside me next time.
Aziza.
What are you doing here?
Looking for my brother.
If I did not know you better, I might think you were lying.
So you know me, Amram.
But do you really see me?
Is there a difference, love?
Aziza.
That means "mighty," correct?
You knew that?
Of course.
He's a Jew.
It's a strong name.
I gave her that name to help her be fearless.
It was my greatest gift to her.
Gift?
To be fearless is to be blind.
Where are we with the siege walls?
Progressing fast, General.
I had a dream last night.
I saw Masada crumbling under the mighty ram of Rome.
You did?
Yes.
In my dream, we were right there, right against these walls.
You don't believe dreams come true.
Nor do I.
But in my hands, this one will.
Because I shall make it so.
A little higher, then draw.
Just to the left.
It's not too late, Yael.
- Come with me. - Shh, shh.
They'll hear you, they'll hear you.
Baruch atah, Adonai
Elohanu, melech ha'olam,
Asher kidishanu b'mitz votav, v'tzivenu
L'had'lich neir shel Shabbat.
You invited Eleazar to your Shabbat dinner?
Yes.
We were together, breaking bread as a family for the first time.
Did Aziza know that Eleazar was her father?
No.
But they had a special bond.
I hear you make the finest arrows, Aziza, and shoot even better.
She shoots better than anyone, even though she's left-handed.
I am, too.
But I shoot with my right.
So do I.
Cross the cold ocean for me.
I will.
Where the fish are as big as men.
It's not too late, Ya-Ya.
You know I can't come with you.
Wynn.
Pale snow.
Baruch hashem.
This is for you. You may need it when you go into battle next time.
Much deserved gift for a warrior.
Thank you.
See?
They believe I am you.
Have I done well as a warrior?
Yes.
Very well.
And have I slain many?
Only when you needed to.
You are my armor, my sword, my treasure.
My love.
Everything I'm fighting for.
I'm not the only thing you're fighting for.
Eleazar.
Yes?
Do you think this child will ever see peace?
That's what I'll be fighting for.
You're with child?
Yes.
So the legacy of your great leader lives on.
A siege tower.
They can't use that here.
We're too high.
It will never work.
Romans don't build for nothing.
And what about that stone wall?
Doesn't makes any sense.
We can climb over it.
It won't keep us out.
It's not to keep us out, Amram.
It's to keep us in.
It's a siege wall.
Time was running out for you.
You must have known this.
Yes.
Some looked to reconcile with their loved ones and make peace with their lives.
There you are.
You were looking for me?
I wanted to say thank you.
I owe you my life.
You don't owe me anything.
Why are you always by yourself?
You're never with the others.
I'm not by myself.
My wife was... raped and beaten by Roman soldiers.
And I was there for her last breath.
And I have carried it with me ever since.
So I'm never alone.
And I also made an oath that... I would never be with another woman after she died.
Well... I am not a woman.
I'm a warrior.
What color was my mother's hair?
You never guessed why I cannot look at you?
I only saw hatred in your eyes.
When I saw you, I saw your mother.
Her hair was red as the sun.
Just like yours.
Where have you been?
I see you with your mother and your brother, but you don't come to me anymore.
You're watching me?
Is this a new game, little dove?
Staying away from me to make me desire you more?
Amram!
You dare to run from me? Huh? !
You dare to run from me?
You belong to me!
Do you understand me?
!
I chose you!
Is this what you want?
!
If this is what you want, then do it.
This is not the stuff of dreams, Claudius.
This is what we will use to break these rebels.
I see nothing but a slope, sir.
We will build a ramp on this slope.
A ramp?
And when the ramp reaches high enough, we will pull the siege tower to the top and break through that wall.
The rest will be simple.
We will create what they think only their God could form.
A cliff that reaches up from the floor of the valley.
We'll grab them in our fists and pluck them off their mountain.
They'll never breach that gap.
They would need a mountain of rocks to reach our walls.
They already moved a mountain of sand.
We cannot fight a mountain, but we can fight those who seek to move it.
You want to attack the ramp?
This is suicide.
Tonight.
Pass the word.
What do you want?
Only a minute.
You wanted my life.
I wanted my husband.
Then go to him!
Please.
Only you can grant me the protection of his life.
I'm not a magician, Channa!
Get out!
Tonight the warriors are going out to try to stop the building of the ramp.
They will not all return.
I beg of you Shirah, save Eleazar.
Even if it's only for yourself.
I cannot divine God's will.
Don't do this for me.
Do this for the man we love.
The story of the poisoned water was a mystery to the people of Masada.
Our warriors found the bodies of their enemies lying on the ground.
It was a mystery to the Romans as well.
They believed it was the work of demons.
And you believed it?
What Yael did was incredible.
The poison had done its work.
She was a woman unafraid.
A shining star before the eyes of God.
Now it was sealed between us.
I had seen her destiny was entwined with mine.
It was you.
This is your destiny.
To give women what they need most.
They will come to us for this.
Yael, everything my mother taught me, and her mother before her, will be yours now.
All the secrets that bind a mother and a daughter together for eternity.
Shirah, I am not worthy of it.
Yes, you are.
Snakeskin from the black viper.
Ash from the fire.
Strings tied in knots.
It's all in here.
We're the keepers of the memory, Yael.
Our duty is to pass the story down.
Flavius Silva says here:
"We worked day and night "to get the ramp closer to the wall,
"the Jews unleashed barrages of burning oil, "arrows and stones onto the soldiers and the slaves."
Little good that it did.
Slaves kept filling the gap with boulders while the soldiers kept up volley after volley of arrows into the fortress.
Arms, loose!
And then the barrage halted.
Only silence from the other side of the ramp.
Eleazar Ben Ya'ir!
- Bring more arrows...
- Shh!
I am Lucius Flavius Silva, General of the Tenth Legion and Governor of Judea.
I offer you peace.
Let me kill him.
I won't miss this time.
Quiet!
Eleazar Ben Ya'ir!
Do you wish your people to live or to die?
Tell your people if they surrender, they shall go free.
They have the word of Flavius Silva.
Masada... delenda est.
You were doomed from then on.
We begged God to protect us.
But your God wasn't listening.
What did you do to save yourselves, hmm?
Your unborn child?
What did you do?
We comforted each other.
You comforted each other!
Yes!
Don't cry, my love.
There's no time for that.
When I look at you, I don't see the face the enemy sees.
I see the man I met in Jerusalem, with eyes deep like the dove.
And now our story will be lost forever.
No.
It cannot be lost.
You're right.
It has to live.
For our child.
You have to live.
You have to live.
What are you saying?
I cannot breathe without you.
You're my destiny.
Let us not speak.
Let us not speak.
Let us lie together and forget the world.
Remember only each other.
It's called a siege tower.
The Romans love to use it to crush their enemies.
Our warriors were fighting back.
Sadly, an exercise in futility.
Your weapons would be useless against it.
From inside the siege tower, the Romans could attack and yet still be protected from your arrows.
Ingenious.
And then they could use a ram to strike against the walls of Masada.
Archers... loose!
Archers, loose!
Release the ram!
- Release the ram!
- Release the ram!
Ready!
Pull!
Pull!
For the glory of Rome!
Move to the right!
Ready!
Prepare the catapult.
Destroy it!
Now!
Ignite!
Release!
They're going to breach the wall!
Gather the people!
Our enemy is upon us and we can hold them back no longer.
But we can deny them victory!
Our God does not allow us to harm ourselves.
It is the greatest sin, to take one's own life.
- But we cannot be slaves!
- No.
We cannot see our families tortured and cut into pieces!
Let us go out of this world with our wives and children free.
Let us carry the burden of our sin.
We shall slay ourselves!
Ten death givers shall be chosen and the last one will take on the burden of all our sins and slay himself.
Eleazar chose the men who were to give death.
I looked out at all these families, my brothers and sisters, clutched together in desperate embraces.
And who would believe this?
What lies would the Romans tell?
Someone had to live to tell this story.
It was our fate to survive.
Come with us.
We have been commanded to die.
I cannot live without him.
Then live for him.
For all of them.
To tell our story, Shirah.
Aziza.
Aziza.
We have to stay together.
Come.
Come.
Amram.
Aziza!
Aziza!
Stop!
Come back.
Why couldn't you love me?
Why... couldn't you love me?
Why?
Why...
I take the last breath of your life with me.
My warrior.
Wait!
Wait!
Shirah.
I give you the last breath and the soul of your daughter, Aziza.
Take her with you.
Wherever you may go.
Neshama.
It was a scene from hell.
Families laid out, preparing for their deaths.
Look.
You are with my mother.
Baruch hashem.
Shirah!
I don't fear death.
I would have died a hundred times to have had your love.
You've always had it, my love.
Always.
Do this for me.
So I can die with honor.
Go.
There's someone down there.
Come out. Now.
This is Flavius Silva.
"We saw only vultures and ravens circling "overhead, and charred bodies "lying in rows.
"Even the soldiers were disturbed by the multitude of slain before their eyes."
Is it true you passed these things by?
"There was not a living soul left.
"Everything had been destroyed.
We were at a loss to guess what happened."
You lived through this tide of death.
Over 900 people slayed themselves and everyone they loved rather than be captured by the Romans.
Whores and their whelps.
Don't waste wooden nails crucifying them.
Let's run them through now.
What happened to your people?
Where is the man who led you, Eleazar Ben Ya'ir?
He is murdered.
How could he be murdered?
We had not yet come over the wall, and all were already dead.
My name is Shirah, and I can tell you the story of this fortress.
I only ask one favor in return.
And who are you to ask such a favor?
The closest companion to Eleazar Ben Ya'ir.
We have need of your favor, great general, and you of ours.
There will be no one alive to tell the Romans what happened here.
Victory or disgrace?
Who will know?
What is this favor?
Our lives.
The Romans wanted us to say that we were led to our destruction by a reckless fool named Eleazar Ben Ya'ir, that our warriors cowered in fear as Flavius Silva ground Masada to the dust under his heels.
But we have told you the truth.
We didn't save ourselves to tell you a lie.
We saved ourselves to honor our brothers and sisters.
In telling their story, this is our kaddish for them.
And so it continues through our children and the children of their children so that this story never dies.
I will write your story as you've told it to me.
Let them be free.
Shalom.
- Shalom.
- Shalom.
Here is the riddle of love.
Everything it gives you it takes away.
But I ask you, would you have it any other way?
You know what they say.
Hear the cry of the banshee and die!
Actually it's banshee cries, somebody dies.
Today it's you.
Missed both my hearts.
I do love postmasters.
Killing them is so lucrative.
Who's paying you?
Not everyone can afford assassin of calibre.
I deal with all Reacher's loose ends.
Gilt.
The Dearheart boy screamed like a pig.
Screamed like a pig!
Till he struck the ground.
Time to shut up shop, Postmaster.
This is not Reacher Gilt's Post Office to close.
It belongs to the city.
How dare he come in here and destroy it.
Oh, please!
Can't I even die in peace?
I mean, I'm no angel, but him?
He's a devil.
"Upon discovery of fire, remain calm."
"Shout 'fire' in a loud, clear voice."
Fire!
Stanley.
"If trapped await A, rescue or B, death."
Straightforward enough.
A it is, then.
Come on.
I owe you.
Where are the fire brigade?
We have no insurance.
What?
I'm sorry, sir, it was fire insurance or food.
Where are the buckets then?
This is beyond buckets, Mr Lipwig.
Adora.
Care for a dance?
A dance?
With you?
A self-centred skuggem with the moral fibre of a...
A rat?
A rat.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Let me go!
Not until I've told you what's really going on.
You destroyed my family, that's what's going on.
That was an accident.
I can put it right.
You don't know the meaning of the word "right".
Those dead postmasters, Gilt had them killed.
He tried to kill me, too.
Who'd have thought I had something in common with Reacher Gilt?
Adora, he murdered your brother.
John wore a safety line, but he fell to his death.
It doesn't make sense, unless you hire a flying banshee to push him.
And banshees are Gilt's weapon of choice.
You've got proof?
Of course.
Well, the banshee was my proof.
He knew everything.
Except how to be fireproof.
How convenient!
Even so, I think I can bring down Reacher Gilt.
All talk and no action, as usual.
Adora, will you trust me just this once?
Does that answer your question?
Any comment to go with the picture, Mr Lipwig?
Reacher.
Marvellous, isn't it?
A bit extreme?
The point is, Horsefry, we've won.
We've won.
Well, I suppose that's one way to deal with the backlog.
How can you joke?
That's our life.
And it's gone.
Be brave, Mr Groat.
There's our customers over there.
Sending clacks, we've lost them.
Then we'II just have to win them back again, won't we?
Come on, Mr Groat.
The Post Office is open... as usual.
A bit more open than usual, I would say.
Numberfourdelivery,proceed.
Number four delivery.
Stan!
Aggy!
Not many of us old postmen left now, Mr Groat.
We help out the best we can in the post's hour of need.
See?
People love the Post Office.
So...
Get your men organised, Deputy Postmaster Groat.
I want them...
Did you say deputy postmaster, sir?
And, what's more, I want your men out on the streets delivering the mail today.
Yes, sir.
Looks like the clacks is down again.
This really is my lucky day.
Special today, ladies and gentlemen, mail to Pseudopolis reduced to three pence.
Three pence only.
And if anyone has a message already stuck in the clacks, we'll deliver it for free.
No matter how hard I scrape my shoe,
Lipwig remains stuck to it.
It says here he was unscathed.
Does this mean we have to try again?
No. He may be alive, but he's yesterday's man.
Knowing Lipwig, he'll rebuild.
With what?
Lt'll cost a fortune.
And the... Post Office is bankrupt.
Nevertheless, people seem to have a fondness for the post.
My latest innovation will change all that.
Innovation?
We closed down research and development years ago.
This isn't about research, Horsefry.
This is about dazzling the masses with a bauble.
I believe the respectable term is marketing.
We are proud to usher in a new era.
The mobile era.
A network of towers like this will move around Discworld as demand requires.
This doesn't look good.
In future, if you can't get to a clacks tower, the clacks tower will be brought to you.
Full coverage for the entire Disc.
Mr Gilt, today's increase in the price of clacks messages is the fifth this year.
Surely that is extortion.
This is the future of long-distance communication, and new technology is not cheap.
Would you really have that when you can have this?
But he had the Post Office destroyed.
We have no proof, Mr Pump.
We must do something.
Follow me.
Arrest those men!
For what?
Vandalising clacks property.
I think you'll find the only offence here is trespass.
Your map was being paraded on Post Office property.
I'll see you paraded through hell, Lipwig.
Are you going to send another assassin to sort me out?
Assassin? I have no idea what you're talking about.
Mr Gryle and I had a very interesting chat.
I know exactly what you've been up to.
Where's your proof?
All in good time.
You're such a fraud.
And you're such a murderer.
That is slander.
This is a declaration of war.
Can I quote you on that?
If you want a quote, Miss Cripslock, try this.
Neither rain nor fire can stop the post.
Very stirring.
But his quote had "war" in it.
Fine talk, sir.
Fine talk. You do give a good bite of sound.
If you don't mind me saying, it's bugger all help.
I know, I know.
They come through with a new technological breakthrough.
"A modern miracle that will change communications for ever."
And we haven't even got a roof.
Oh, one decent downpour and all this will be papier-mache.
Big roofs cost big money.
That's it, Mr Groat.
Rain.
Rainy days.
The problem with people who put money away for a rainy day is they never know when it's raining.
Well, I think it's about to pour.
Stress.
It does funny things to a man.
Sausage?
Mrs Leakall's Premium Reserve sausages.
A special offering.
Because I have a special prayer.
Well, you're off to a good start.
Tell me, how do you actually get the sausages up there?
The gift of sausages ascends onto Offler, the sacred crocodile, by means of smell.
And then you... eat the sausage?
A common misconception.
But the true sausagidity goes to Offler.
He eats the... essence of the sausages.
While we priests eat the earthly shell.
That would explain why the smell of sausages is always better than the actual taste, perhaps.
You should have been a theologian.
So, what is your prayer to accompany Mrs Leakall's finest?
Just the usual.
Pennies from heaven.
$150,000... to be precise.
Might take more than a few sausages to get something that... specific.
But... let's give it a shot.
Post!
Post!
Good work, Stanley.
That'll do it.
Forwards, Stanley, forwards.
Post.
Come on.
Everyone loves getting a letter.
I think it's best you stay away from Miss Adora.
Stay away?
I can't do that, she loves me.
But she just tried to kill you.
Well, the human heart is a complex thing, Mr Pump.
Love, hate, they're just a breath apart.
She doesn't know it yet, but she loves me.
Mr Pump.
That's your third delivery today.
Many letters survived the fire.
We are working round the clock to deliver them.
Round the clock?
Without a break.
That is how much we believe in Postmaster Lipwig.
But that's exploitation.
The Golem Trust can't allow it.
You misunderstand.
We volunteered.
Volunteered?
That is the worst form of exploitation.
Rats.
What are you doing, Horsefry?
I need it for my budget.
Budget?
I need to know how many towers we're going to build.
Do you know what I really like about you, Horsefry?
Your naivety.
Sorry, don't quite get you.
We put up the clacks charges to finance a fleet of towers, right?
But we don't actually build any.
So the extra revenue becomes pure profit.
But won't people want to see some towers?
Well, we'll wheel out that fancy model every now and then, give the idiots some eye candy to gawp at.
Meanwhile, the mobile clacks project is officially in development.
Shame.
I thought it was a good idea.
Horsefry, Horsefry.
They aim of business is?
Erm... Not to provide a good service, but to provide the...
Only.
...only service.
They seem very taken with the new-fangled towers, sir.
It's the oldest trick in the book.
Dazzle the punter with a pretty picture.
What's a punter?
They haven't even built the mobiles yet, have they?
It's all promise.
Know what happens to promises.
Will the people ever come back to us?
How would they be able to resist when we have our new state-of-the-art Post Office?
Not in our lifetime.
You underestimate me, Mr Groat.
I don't want to hurt your feelings, but praying for money is a bit desperate, don't you think?
There's a god out there for everyone.
The trick is hooking up with -
Mr Lipwig!
Mr Lipwig!
Mr Lipwig!
The light.
The wonderful light.
Glory be to Offler.
The sacred crocodile god.
Oh!
He's blind.
He's blind.
Mr Lipwig, sir.
Mr Lipwig!
Mr Lipwig!
One regular white, one skinny Klatchian.
And two figgins, please.
Somebody call a doctor.
Can you see nothing at all?
Are you totally blind?
Only blind to this world, my friend.
Now I perceive the inner truth.
Yes.
The angels of Offler whisper onto me.
One... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars. Buried... in a forest.
Offler.
I am not worthy.
Let the angels choose a holy witness.
Me, me!
I'll give you the front page.
You are chosen.
Offler says... to the hop gate.
And bring a shovel.
Divine intervention.
Show me the way!
The praying man.
It is here.
The praying man under the praying tree.
Looks like an elephant to me.
Well, now you mention it, I can definitely see a praying man.
He can see.
What's going on?
You're under arrest, that's what's going on.
Hello again.
Mr Lipwig.
I demand you step aside.
Can't you wait until Mr Lipwig returns?
Mr Lipwig is in breach of contract.
But we golems are satisfied with him.
You've been manipulated by him.
Not manipulated.
Persuaded.
Now you're making me angry.
Pump 19.
I will assemble the golems.
Mr Lipwig.
You've had a most strenuous day, have you not?
Can't be as strenuous as signing death warrants.
Joke.
Oh, I'm sorry, I hadn't realised.
Do tell me if you feel obliged to make another.
To be honest, today has all been a bit of a blur.
There's $150,000 buried in the forest.
And you have no idea how it got there.
It's miraculous.
A remarkable coincidence that it is precisely the sum of money that was hidden by a notorious conman.
Conman?
Who was that then?
We hanged him.
He's dead.
Isn't he?
Yes.
He's dead.
Excellent.
So, as this money is a gift from the gods, it should be used for the public good, should it not?
The eyes, Mr Lipwig. Hmm?
You can trust me.
Oh, that.
Made from turtle egg shells.
Ingenious.
Thank you.
I meant me for making you postmaster.
Ah. Marvellous.
Mr Lipwig.
But if I'm to restore the Post Office, I have to pay the builders.
Send the bills to Drumknott.
Your job is to make sure that Reacher Gilt is in no position to burn the Post Office down again.
He's a murderer.
An accusation for which you have hard evidence?
Your spies could find some evidence, no doubt.
Spies?
I did hear there was a man on the inside.
But he was dropped from his position.
Quite literally.
John Dearheart was your spy?
He was a spy.
But he didn't get very far.
Perhaps if he'd possessed the agile mind of a conman, he might have had more success as a spy.
You think I'm some thug piece to be moved around at your leisure?
Precisely.
No.
I won't be your spy.
Shame.
Miss Dearheart would have been impressed.
Indeed it is the very essence of golem.
But enough is enough.
This postmaster, this Lipwig, is an exploiter.
The Golem Trust can't allow it and won't allow it.
Just because you don't need a tea break doesn't mean you're not entitled to one.
Right now the Post Office needs you more than you need it.
There is only one course of action to take in those circumstances.
Strike and strike hard.
So what do we want?
OK.
OK, let's go straight to the vote.
All those in favour of an immediate withdrawal of labour raise your hand.
Oh, I see.
I suppose you all think the sun shines out of Lipwig's backside.
Very well.
But don't come running to me when you're so worn out that the only thing you're able to hold is a pot plant.
Adora.
Adora, wait.
How dare you turn my golems against me.
You're the one who said they can't be manipulated.
The brochure is being revised.
Did you know your brother was a spy for Lord Vetinari?
You really will say anything just to get my attention.
It's the truth.
Let my brother rest in peace.
Fine, then here's what we'll do.
We'll keep on fighting day and night.
We'II make sure we never share information that could damage the clacks.
That way Reacher Gilt's sure to win.
You think you're the only one who can bring down Reacher Gilt.
The arrogance, the conceit.
I don't need you.
I'll show you just how much I don't need you.
The one-woman crusade, how noble.
You'll see.
The whole city will see.
Good work, lads.
Are we ready, Mr Groat?
Just a few more, sir.
Bet you're glad you invented perforations, eh, Stanley?
Strange thing is some people are sending letters to themselves.
What?
Once the stamp has been through the post it makes it more real.
You see, people are collecting them.
Just like you and your pins, eh?
Pins?
Oh, pins.
No, pins are just pointy metal things.
Readytoroll,sir .
All you good people of the city. Now run in conjunction with Hobson's Livery, it gives me great pleasure to crack the whip on the overnight express to Sto Lat.
So much for us having won.
How dare the gods work against me.
I don't remember giving them permission.
Why don't we just concentrate on our own business?
Because Lipwig's taking our business.
Look at them.
One artist's impression...
and they believe.
Of course, posting the letter is one thing.
Making sure it arrives is another thing altogether.
Oh, here we go again.
What's up?
It's jammed.
Maybe it's iced up.
Better call maintenance.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Like we got three days to waste.
Princess, you've got to come and see this.
I'm looking right at it.
A fault?
It seems it's spreading right through the system, which is why we need to shut everything down now.
Shut down the entire clacks?
It's the only way.
Did I tell you the good news, Mr Pony?
I'm recommending you for a pay rise.
A substantial pay rise.
And I'm pushing for a bonus, too.
That's very generous of you, Mr Gilt.
Nothing less than you deserve, Mr Po-
Or may I call you George.
Problem is, George, I have to answer to the board.
And what will they say when my very next sentence is,
"Mr Pony wants to shut down the clacks."
Well, you don't have to be a boardroom veteran to work that one out, do you?
I want you to have that bonus, George.
I really do.
So I'm going to ask you just one more time.
Are you absolutely sure you can't solve this technical hiccough without having to shut down the whole system?
Well, maybe we can come at it from a different angle.
By damn it, George, you've talked me into it.
I'll tell the board you've got the whole thing under control.
Your skill and ingenuity will be the saving of the company.
I hadn't budgeted for any pay rises, Reacher.
You won't have to.
Money dangled is much more effective than money given.
Er, talking of wages.
How much did you pay the banshee in the end?
What does it matter?
I just need to reconcile my ledger.
You mean you actually intend to write down how much I paid an assassin?
I've always done it in the past.
Well, got to keep records, Reacher.
Can't cover your tracks if you don't know where you've left them.
And is that the only ledger?
No, I've got dozens of them going back years.
I'd love to see them, Horsefry.
Really?
Yes.
They're in my office.
Come up any time.
Now, Crispin.
I want to see them.
Now.
Never shown any interest before.
No.
Well, I'm very interested in settling accounts.
Thank you.
There you are.
So that's what she meant.
Mr Lipwig, sir.
Oh, calamity.
The mail coach is back, sir.
Already?
But there's no mail.
And not much coach.
So efficient.
Thank you.
Nice to be appreciated.
What have you done, Horsefry?
Er my job.
Account for things.
Damn you.
Account for this.
Reacher, no!
Leave it.
What are you doing?
Saving us from prison.
But we have to keep account.
Your job is to hide things, not to declare them for the whole world to see.
Please, Reacher!
It is my life's work.
Get off me, you fat fool.
Look at you.
Loose flesh, loose tongue, loose brain.
Just loose everything.
The fact is, Horsefry, you're too stupid to live.
Found the fault yet, Mr Pony?
I - I...
Mr Horsefry was taken ill.
It left a nasty stain on the carpet.
I sent him home.
But can't stand the smell.
Mr Pony, that's not the look of a man who's in for a substantial pay rise.
Better.
Adora, that's a really neat trick you pulled off.
I knew you'd see it my way.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Freezing the towers.
That was very slick.
The trouble is, right now the Post Office is down, too.
Bandits.
Hmm.
How careless of you.
We need a double whammy.
As you hit the clacks, we can steal their business.
A synchronised attack.
I wouldn't synchronise with you if you were the last person on the Disc.
40 Passing Clouds, please.
You know what?
You're right.
You don't need me.
You're more than capable of bringing down Reacher Gilt on your own.
You've got it all under control so I'll just walk away and leave you in peace.
You won't ever hear from me again.
Two...
Don't you want to know how I did it?
Go out onto the Post Office roof.
Get yourself a little bit closer to Heaven.
Then get down on your knees and pray.
You know how to pray, don't you?
Just put your hands together and hope.
Hello?
She said pray.
Hope you don't mind about the sausage business. But, to be perfectly honest, I think we both came out of it looking pretty good.
Anyway, I was wondering if -
Is this about the rent?
Who the hell are you?
We paid Mr Groat.
So you'll have to take it up with him.
Forget Groat.
What are you doing on my roof?
I'm Mad Al.
He's Sane Alex.
And that's Adrian.
He says he's not mad but you can't prove it, can you?
We're pigeon fanciers.
So where are the pigeons?
Out flying.
Pigeons don't fly at night.
Bats.
We're trying to breed homing bats.
Bats don't have a homing instinct.
Yes.
Tragic, isn't it?
Yeah, because sometimes I come up here at night and I just see their empty little perches.
As all I can do not to cry.
Well, I'm sure Lord Vetinari will be fascinated to hear all about it.
You know, I quite enjoyed seeing you on your knees.
Adora.
The Smoking GNU, actually.
You can really jam the whole clacks system from a pigeon loft?
Nice trick.
Trick?
This is cutting edge cracking.
Two years in development.
Iterative beta testing.
Culminating in this.
Away you go, boys.
Firing out from here into the Grand Trunk.
Then...
Jam.
But before it jams, it's already passed the code on.
So...
Jam.
The problem started at this tower.
And I think one of you has been meddling.
Was it him?
Was this his idea of a joke?
No, sir.
He didn't do anything.
Then it must have been you.
You with a juvenile sense of humour.
Stay back.
I'll have to drop every employee until someone -
I've got it.
I know what's happened.
One moment, Mr Pony.
I'm just disposing of some assets.
Hey!
That's my niece.
Oh, that is useful to know.
It's a strange aperture.
It's jumping off the elliptical bearing.
I can fix it.
If you hit Q and then K, and the resonant frequency to sent it to Genua, when the pressure is higher than ours -
Spare me the details.
Can you trace it?
Well, there's over 10,000 messages here.
I might be able to find it.
Thank you.
There, there.
Better stop down now.
When the sun comes up, they can see us. Shh.
See?
We can do to the clacks what my stiletto did to your foot.
It's not a bad start.
Not bad?
As long as we're sending, Reacher Gilt doesn't earn a single dollar.
Ah, but if we worked together while you're stabbing his foot, I can be picking his pocket.
The great thing about the Post Office is we don't rely on complicated machines.
We have hands and feet.
And strong ones at that.
Heave away, Mr Pump.
Ladies, gentlemen, don't get caught in the clacks.
Come join us at the Post Office.
We'II get your message delivered.
You see, the clacks system works at the cutting edge of technology.
And in the white heat of progress there are sometimes complications.
But I can assure you there are now all resolved.
Some people are saying -
And we'll be providing refunds for any messages that have been lost.
All you have to do is fill in the claim form.
But I do urge your readers not to do anything as rash as writing a letter and sending it by post.
Wouldn't you -
You might as well tear it up and scatter it to the four winds.
Mr Gilt, this claim form is 50 pages long.
A help desk will be provided.
But, please, don't get bogged down in the details.
What really matters is we fly high above the bandits.
I will wager my hat of office that the clacks will have broken down by sunset tonight.
And when we win, I'll burn his ludicrous hat of office in this.
Now to collect on that wager.
Ready to stick the stiletto in?
The pleasure's all ours.
So, how long does it take?
It should have got to the first tower already.
I must say, it's looking distinctly underwhelming.
It's alright leaving us.
So much for iterative beta testing.
Don't shout at me.
I'm not shouting.
I'm just calmly stating.
Well, just don't.
Is it possible they could have cracked our code?
Just as I was beginning to like the hat.
Stop whining, Lipwig.
I'm not whining, I'm just -
I'd like to know why the GNU isn't smoking.
I'm sure you've talked your way out of worse situations before.
That was the old Lipwig, remember?
I'm a changed man now.
Mr Lipwig, sir.
Mr... oh.
Mr Lipwig, sir.
Mr Groat.
I imagine Gilt's demanding the hat.
You're not gonna let them have it, are you?
What's that I hear?
Nothing.
Moist Von Lipwig has nothing to say.
Have we lost everything?
Relax, Mr Groat.
I'm not done yet.
All I have to do is attempt the impossible.
As you can see, the sun has set and the clacks system is working perfectly.
All that remains is for the Postmaster to admit defeat.
But where is he?
Another empty promise.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I have a fondness for the quaint old Post Office.
It's part of our history.
But, really, that is where it belongs.
Did someone ask for me?
Ah, Postmaster.
Just in time.
The fire was getting low.
Well if you're too scared to rise to the challenge. Have it.
Challenge?
An overnight race from here to Uberwald.
The clacks versus the post.
That's over a thousand miles away.
1,700 miles, to be precise, Miss Cripslock.
Mr Gilt, do you accept the challenge?
Accept?
How could the clacks possibly lose?
Well, you've made quite a splash. As the fish said to the man with the lead weight tied to his feet.
Perhaps I'm missing something.
No, my lord, it's a straight race.
But you can't possibly win.
I agree, it won't be easy.
And I must insist that the race is run fairly with strict rules.
I have no intention of cheating.
And I ask for no favours.
All I ask is that when I win, Reacher Gilt hands over the entire clacks network.
Very well.
But I have a condition of my own.
If you lose, Mr Lipwig, you hang.
Really?
It seems a little harsh.
But fair.
If you lose, you will have outlived your usefulness.
Having second thoughts, Postmaster?
Let's race.
Very good, sir.
The worried look.
Very convincing.
Throws them off the scent.
Yes.
But how do you know I'm not really worried?
Because you're the man who got money out of the gods, sir.
Ah.
Yeah.
Supposing I did that with a trick?
Damn good trick, sir, damn good.
A man who can trick money out of the gods is capable of anything, sir.
Mr Groat. Hmm?
What if I told you that, er... There's no way a coach can get to Uberwald faster than the clacks machines?
Of course you have to say that, sir.
Because the walls have ears, eh?
Mum's the word.
Everything?
Everything.
But there's 15 years of work here.
He's grown out of pins.
Sir, pins are for life.
They stick with you.
He's starting a new life.
Isn't that right, Stanley?
So.
How much?
Dave, what do you think about stamps?
So... what's the plan?
How can you possibly win?
Friction.
The coach will be so shiny it'II glide through the air.
Meanwhile back in the real world The Post Office is a hopeless underdog.
Ah, but the underdog can always find somewhere soft to bite.
This is no time for witty banter.
We're not on a date.
Do you have a plan?
Do you trust me?
No.
Do you have a plan?
Of course.
We got 50-1. 50-1, sir.
I took all me savings, Stanley here sold his pin collection and we put the whole lot on you to win the race.
No, no, no.
The whole lot?
Perhaps that wasn't so wise.
50-1.
But we don't want to appear greedy. Do we?
I mean, we want to keep the moral high ground.
Bugger the moral high ground.
We'll be rich.
It's all thanks to your inspired plan, sir.
Mr Groat. What?
Let's go and see if the golems want to cash in.
Good idea, lad.
Oh, my God.
There is no inspired plan.
There.
Right between your eyes.
The next time I see you, that's where I'm aiming.
Messages can be blocked.
I trust you have discovered Lipwig's plan.
I'm afraid not, sir.
Only a fool would challenge the clacks with a horse and cart.
He must have a trick up his sleeve.
Now what is it?
All I can promise you, sir, is the clacks won't let you down.
We're clearing all messages off the system, running double bandwidth, I'm putting all my best operators -
You just remember, if I'm made to look a fool, your pretty little niece will rue the day her Uncle Pony got her a job at the clacks!
Archchancellor Ridcully, my lord.
This had better be important, I'm in the middle of an experiment.
Involving a knife and fork, no doubt.
I wouldn't expect a layman to understand the pressures of university life.
Incredible though it may seem, we have found a practical use for one of your magical devices.
Have you?
The object in question is...
An Omniscope, my lord.
Enabling us to see things at a distance, I believe.
The Omniscope is a highly complex, very unstable piece of equipment.
You mean, it doesn't work?
Well...
Relatively speaking, it works.
Excellent, kindly have it up and running by dawn tomorrow.
Now, listen, magic is not some workmen's tool that you can hire out by the hour.
Just as well, because I wasn't intending to pay you.
Can I help?
Mr Pony.
Miss Adora.
How have you been?
It's nice to see you after all these years.
I'm sorry I never came to your father's funeral.
It didn't seem right.
What happened wasn't your fault.
You must hate me for staying on at the clacks.
You're just doing your job, Mr Pony.
The truth is, clacks is run on blood now.
There's not a day goes by when I wouldn't like to throw my resignation in Reacher Gilt's face.
I'm 58.
Twinges in my knuckles, a sick wife and a bad back.
You have to think twice, don't you, before such gestures?
My father always said you were a good man.
And a great engineer.
I'm sure he was right.
No.
Your father was a great engineer.
Gilt tried to burn these.
I'm sure you'll know what to do with them.
I'm sorry.
Stand by to repel borders.
If this is about what I said earlier...
They killed him.
They killed John and they put his name in a debit column.
These people, they they get away with murder and everyone just looks the other way.
No, not everyone.
Just because you were right, doesn't mean you have to gloat.
Forget gloating.
Now I really do have a plan.
Go away!
All you do is talk of plans.
Crazy, non-existent plans.
What sort of man are you?
Adora, just listen to me.
Give me the crossbow.
Those ledgers are the key to everything!
Just hear me out.
If you don't like the plan, be my guest. Shoot.
This had better be good.
Now then, boys, you take the message and ride hell-for-leather to Uberwald.
But how are we going to get to Uberwald overnight, sir?
You're not, Mr Groat.
Does that mean you're going to hang, Mr Lipwig?
Not if I can help it.
I have a plan, Stan.
I need you to take a little detour. There is a derelict clacks tower and I need you to deliver some canvas and ropes and rigging. Rigging?
Is this about boats, sir.
Only I can't do boats.
I get very seasick.
Not boats, Mr Groat.
Sails.
We are going to block out their message with a sail.
Block it out?
Won't they notice?
Not if we put our own message in its place.
Sorry, sir, could you run that by me again?
Yeah. I got a bit lost at... sail.
Hello!
Hello, Ankh-Morpork!
Welcome to the great race!
Lovely to see you all!
Hello!
Hello.
Nice entrance.
It will make up for your ignominious exit.
Hello, sir.
Citizens of Ankh-Morpork.
As per Lord Vetinari's directive number P1500-
We know why we are here.
To witness a great race!
The Postmaster has challenged the clacks.
Two identical messages must be delivered to Uberwald.
The wizard's Omniscope will show us the finish line.
Get it ready by sunrise, Ridcully, which is when I expect to win.
And to show the spirit of fair play, we have graciously allowed the Post Office to choose the message.
I thought long and hard about an appropriate message.
And then, I remembered how nice it is to receive a parcel.
So, why not a book?
The authorised, illustrated biography of Lord Vetinari.
You think yourself so clever, lt'll buy you a few hours at best.
Our message will still be there by dawn, while your lumbering coach will get bogged down in some godforsaken marsh.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Ready when you are, my lord.
Get clacksing!
Come on, move it!
If we win this race you can have a half-day holiday!
Come on!
Get on with it.
You took a while.
I had to stop a couple of times, all that bumping and jolting, my bladder's not what it used to be.
If we don't get this sail rigged before they start sending, we're done for.
Yeah, alright.
OK!
Ready?
Hoist it up, lads.
Quick as you can. Alright!
Come on, let's get a wriggle on here!
Here, look, stick your boot in there, will you?
Still here, Mr Groat?
I'm not built for parcel post, sir.
Now, you know what to do?
Ride like the clappers, sir.
Good man, stop for nothing.
The mail must get through!
No gloom of night.
Hey, Mr Lipwig.
Exactly, Stanley, no gloom of night. - C-Can I say, sir, even if we lose and the Post Office collapses, and all this was in vain - And you get hanged.
Yes, sir, even dead, you are still the best Postmaster we have ever had.
That's very touching, Mr Groat.
But I'm not dead yet.
Good luck, boys.
Why aren't we sending? !
I want to see those lights flashing!
Where's Mr Pony?
Get me Pony!
That's what I love about the Dearhearts.
Perfect alignment.
Any message coming out of there comes straight through us.
Time to create some interference.
OK, 14!
Number 14!
14's good.
Number 15?
OK, there is a snag on 15!
It's stuck!
It's stuck!
Where's the hammer?
I put it back in the toolbox.
It's not here!
It's in there!
In the spanner drawer!
Yeah, it's still the toolbox!
And who would look for a hammer in the spanner drawer?
Boys!
We haven't got time for this!
A place for everything and everything in its place!
If you say that one more time, I'll find another place for the hammer!
Oh, for God's sake, look!
They're sending!
Let's go, come on!
Grand Trunk are sending the message.
Hurry up!
Pull it up!
Come on boys, pull! It's stuck!
Pull it!
Keep pulling!
It's stuck on something!
If you want something done properly...
Oh no, up we go!
Strange.
The signal's stopped.
No, it can't have, this is top priority.
Send!
Send!
For God's sake, start sending!
It's OK.
They're sending again.
Yes! Yes!
They've taken the bait!
They're passing it on!
Adora!
I'm coming for you!
What kept you?
Adora...
I don't suppose now would be a good time to ask you something?
Well, I can hardly walk away.
Will you marry me?
You are forgetting we still have a race to win.
That's not exactly a rejection.
Not exactly.
Hangon!
Down you get, Mr Lipwig.
You're under arrest.
What for now?
Same as last time.
Doing a runner.
But- but I've come back.
Let's keep it that way.
Lord Vetinari's orders.
Listen.
Nice you have you with us again, sir.
Same last words as before?
I'm rather hoping there'll be a different outcome this time.
Keep your hands off.
Let's see some magic, please.
It'll come in a moment.
Please don't touch it.
There we are.
We need to read the ticker-tape, Archchancellor.
Nobody said anything about a close-up.
Can't you just move it in?
Just move it in?
This is a highly sophisticated magical apparatus.
There we are.
I think we have a winner, my lord. Mm-hmm.
Uberwald receiving station, message as follows.
"Havelock Vetinari was born into a wealthy and influential family."
There we have it, my lord.
The message has arrived, delivered on time by clacks technology.
The clacks has won.
Never mind, sir.
It could be worse.
How, exactly?
Well, we've got a good crowd, lots of press.
They'd even promised me a review in "What Gallows?".
Pull the lever, Mr Trooper.
No, wait.
The message hasn't finished yet.
They're playing for time!
My Lord, it's clear the race is over.
I demand my prize.
My last words!
I haven't had my last words.
If he must.
Strange as it may seem, as I stand here on the verge of oblivion I have a great sense of relief.
I no longer fear the worst because, frankly, the worst has happened.
And although I may not have always been a model citizen, finally I've been made to see the error of my ways.
Not by the heavy hand of the law, but by the gentle touch of well.
By the gentlest touch of all.
Very nice, sir.
Stand by.
No, there's more.
Where's it gone?
It's not coming back.
Give it a moment.
Don't breathe on it.
The man who has never known love has never really lived.
Get on with it.
But worst is the man who avoids love.
Too true.
Well said, sir.
Now...
Because the man who runs from love and all its trials and tribulations, that man is just conning himself, swindling himself out of true...
Ah.
There we are.
...happiness.
Sorry to interrupt, my lord.
I wish someone would.
I'm not quite sure what this means but I think you ought to hear it.
Message continues.
"We are the voice of the dead."
"The ghosts of those who met a bloody end."
That's enough.
The race is finished.
"Postmaster Mutable pushed from the fifth floor."
"Postmaster Sideburn, his neck broken."
Pack it all away!
Touch nothing.
"John Dearheart, flung to his death from a tower."
"And Crispin Horsefry, clubbed to death by Reacher Gilt."
Turn it off!
"Here follow the facts and figures proving fraud, embezzlement and murder."
"The full record of the clandestine dealings of Reacher Gilt."
My Lord, they're lying.
Lying.
Who are they, exactly?
They're only reading what has been delivered by you.
The message has originated from your own company which makes it a confession.
I confess nothing!
Lipwig!
Your safety is my concern, Mr Lipwig.
Your safety is my concern.
Arrest Reacher Gilt.
He appears to have vanished, my lord.
Find him.
An ingenious plan, Mr Lipwig.
And most effective.
Which is why I have agreed to your request to hand over ownership of the clacks back to the Dearheart family.
Just sign here.
And here.
No need to thank me.
However, as the two of you now run all communications in and out of this city, should I find that my long-range game of thud is interrupted I shall come looking for one of you to blame.
I wonder which one it will be.
By the way, you look great.
Colour really suits you.
Thank you.
Is that as sore as it looks?
Oh, it's not the first time I've been hanged.
A bad habit to get into.
I'll tell you what, I'll give up hanging if you give up smoking.
Too late.
I already quit.
You did that for me?
Why on earth would you think that?
Adora those things I said on the gallows when I was staring death in the face about the gentlest touch of all.
You do know I meant every word?
Yes.
It's amazing the rubbish some people spout when they're trying to save their lives.
Or trying to get a kiss.
Of course, we can't do this.
What now?
Conflict of interest.
You're the Post Office, I'm the clacks.
We're rivals.
Which throws up some very interesting possibilities of a corporate merger, don't you think?
Maybe.
Well, I'd certainly like to get my hands on your assets.
Keep your hands as far away from my assets as humanly possibly.
Ah, Mr Gilt.
I see you are awake.
I don't know what you're talking about.
My name is Merryforth Truman and I've got papers to prove it.
Some wonderful papers they are too, Mr Gilt.
But enough of that.
I've brought you here because I want to talk to you about angels.
Come.
Excuse me, my lord.
I've got a letter here for Merryforth Truman.
Strewth.
He was here, but sadly he didn't believe in angels.
Well, that's a bit of an embuggerance.
We did it, Mr Groat.
Home sweet home.
Stanley, it's not only the race we won.
The bet, remember.
50-1.
Blimey, we're rich.
Let's have the betting slip, then.
I gave it to you, Mr Groat.
Hey?
Oh, yes. I've got it here somewhere.
You can't have lost it, Mr Groat.
50-1.
No, of course.
I remember now.
I've put it somewhere safe.
I, erm I hid it under the mattress.
Which mattress?
The one in that tavern.
Which tavern, Mr Groat?
You remember, that that nice one in Uberwald. Oh!
Uberwald...
Mr Groat, Mr Groat!
Get in the carriage, Mr Groat!
Scott, hurry!
The entire fortress is about to explode, we need to clear the area!
For God's sake, who is this man?
How could he have possibly brought this on us?
How could this happen?
Not a single reply in more than one hour...
Where are the others?
I believe them dead, my son.
They must have still been inside when that man...
Come!
Scott!
Tie the strap around your leg...
I'm getting you out of here...
I'm getting you out...
DAD!
Dad...
Dad...
Dad...
That's war.
Nooo!
Wolf 004, escort.
We return to base, from now you're alone.
Roger that, Wolf 004.
Setting course to Daskasan.
Last week, Kepler's Inc. Defense Facility in Birmingham fell victim to yet another terrorist attack, perpetrated by the infamous cell known as "Philanthropy".
We have just entered the Nagorno region.
165 kilometers of air corridor before pullout.
Thank you guys.
Keep us posted through the intercom.
Oh, it's almost time for our TV message...
What message?
Otacon's idea.
It should be broadcasted... now!
Today, the terrorist group delivered the following message.
We live in an age in which the world has endured the threat of annihilation at the hands of nuclear weapons.
Governments relied on the theory of mutually assured destruction to deter an all-out nuclear war, but this strategy will inevitably fail.
Under no circumstances will we ever stand by while a nation builds Metal Gears or similar weapons.
We shall fight them always, until our annihilation, or theirs.
What we achieved in England turned out to be a critical blow.
According to our informants, all the major defence companies have ceased their activities and the scandal caused by the information we've made public has pushed several Governments to start over and redirect their ambitions.
As a matter of fact, up until about a month ago I though that we were through.
But one last... big problem has emerged.
And it is the very reason why we had to meet in such a hurry at that Russian airport.
We're about to launch you into the Daskasan region, between the borders of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Your mission is to find and secure Senator Abraham Bishop,
In case you're wondering, the answer is yes, he is my father.
I believe I might have told you about his role in my "decision" to enter politics.
I'll find him, be sure of that!
Make no mistake, Snake.
I feel nothing for my father.
There is nothing personal in this objective I'm assigning to you.
Nothing inside of me, with the exception of my DNA, still links me to that person.
Uhm... this sounds familiar.
Abraham Bishop is the only politician to have a strong relationship with the rest of '.
He's been here in Azerbaijan for many years now, but his role here is still unclear.
The most popular theory sees him as an advanced contact in the smuggling of war materials to America-friendly countries, like Georgia.
He must be brought back to the States to stand trial for the bribes he took, a charge Philanthropy is now capable of proving.
Once he's nailed, the only company left on Earth producing Metal Gears will have no one to hide behind.
It doesn't sound so dangerous.
It shouldn't sound so easy either.
The Daskasan region has been through some strange phenomena as of late.
Just what kind of phenomena?
The entire zone located between the borders of Armenia and Azerbaijan has always been hot.
Take the Karabakh zone in the South. It's been at the centre of a ten-year conflict.
But really strange things started to happen just this August.
The inhabitants of the region, who previously hid in their houses in fear of the guerrillas, all turned to the streets in a surge of joy.
Strange news spread through the population rapidly.
Celebration fires were lit just paces away from the corpses of those who were massacred only a few days before.
The combatants of the two opposite factions ceased all hostilities instantly, and went on to build a formidable defensive perimeter in a perfect circle of 30 kilometers around the plateau located right in the middle of Daskasan.
The Washington Post named them "The Overnight Nation".
After a few days of apparent calm, "in the name of Jubal", these people pushed on.
What's that typhoon in the middle of the map?
You'll... see soon enough.
70 kilometers of air corridor.
Daskasan is within sight!
What the hell...
That is... quite an unprecedented atmospheric event, as well as being the reason behind the reconnaissance satellites becoming completely useless.
We've had no data, news or images from the operation area for more than two weeks now.
Due to this, we'll have to drop you quite far from the mission area.
This is to be an absolutely secret infiltration mission.
Weapons and equipment OSP.
No backup.
I know the routine well.
Only not this time.
You'll be armed: this is a regular war zone.
Leaving traces behind will not raise an issue.
And Snake, this time you'll not be alone.
What?
You'll be establishing contact on the ground with two new members of Philanthropy.
The first is Pierre Leclerc, sniper, former member of the Foreign Legion, mercenary at present.
Uhm... not bad for moving through open areas.
Who's the second?
Corporal Elizabeth Laeken, former Delta.
Another mercenary? No.
She's been de-listed due to disciplinary reasons.
You have all their folders in your backpack; there, you'll find all the details you need.
40 kilometers of air corridor.
Time to go.
All right Snake.
It's time.
This mission will last longer than any other you've faced so far.
You'll have to expect almost ten days of extreme conditions, against forces we can't predict.
If you succeed, Philanthropy will cease to exist.
We will have won our battle, and those dreadful weapons will only be a thing of the past.
You've been fighting for this all your life, Snake.
This time, you can finally put an end to it.
I know.
Snake, have you found Leclerc?
I'm looking for him.
I'll keep you updated.
Roger that.
Private...
Wait, wait, wait...
What the...
Saved! Pierre Leclerc at your service, Sir.
Yes, Snake?
Who-is-this-jackass?
Any problem?
No, really.
I found him playing with a... a sort of a...
THING!
Thing?
One of those game machines!
Snake, do not worry.
He IS one of the best snipers on the market.
He comes from a family of great tradition.
You may have heard of the legendary Leclerc, hero of World War II.
Pierre here is his nephew!
I'm not dragging this nutcase along!
Snake, there are no alternatives.
You need Pierre.
Got a feeling I'll be missing my solo missions...
Where to, Big Chief?
Laeken should be here any minute now.
I need you to find the guide that will lead us to Imeret.
Name?
Vitalij.
Characteristic traits?
Nasty, filthy, hairy. A local.
Well, look what we have here.
Are you a racist or am I just turning your off?
Just relax, Big Chief!
Let's say I want to keep our conversation on a "hierarchical" level a little longer.
Now move your ass and find him.
He's the only one here with a Russian name, or so they say.
You shouldn't have any problem.
You want the lady just for yourself, don't you?
What the hell has got into your head?
Nothing!
I just thought this wasn't a good way to start a relationship.
You know, all that "you look for the nasty, filthy, and hairy dude. Leave the rest to me" attitude.
Later, Big Chief!
I'm gonna KILL him.
Bye, sister.
And say "Hi" to your next commander!
Elizabeth Laeken?
What was that stone for?
For reasons... I hope you'll never discover.
Want to explain?
'course you don't...
Where did you find him?
I'd say right under our noses.
Remember that stall to the right of the house where we first met?
Well, that's where he was, staring at the wall.
Staring at the wall?
Yes.
You've really got yourself a sensational team here, Big Chief.
Thank God for me!
She knows her stuff.
Who is she?
You haven't briefed me yet.
You're asking yourself whether I can be trusted or not, aren't you?
Well, Big Chief, you have read my profile...
Sure. And it doesn't match with what's in front of me.
Like it or not, we're going to be stuck here for ten days.
I can stand my ground.
Her name is Elizabeth, but they call her "Disgrace".
I've read her profile too.
"Disgrace", uhm?
What has she done?
101st Airborne, Ranger course, six years in the Delta.
Four missions abroad.
Goddammit.
I doubt she's been through any deep infiltration mission like this one.
She's stealth, not a pathfinder.
Anyway, she knows how to handle herself in a fight. Although that wasn't always enough, it would seem...
Meaning what?
All of her commanding officers have bitten the bullet.
Fatal accidents, drowning, friendly fire...
The list is shocking.
Nine Officers.
She's been on leave for some years, but as a civilian she lived the life of a recluse.
No friends.
And with that stain over her head, not a hint of a job, either.
I don't believe this sort of shit.
But I do know you Americans tend to fall for easy explanations...
I won't let all of this become a burden for her.
But she has to keep up.
According to the report, in her last missions she consciously risked her own life without just cause.
She was awarded the Silver Star, but her superiors wanted to get rid of the problem.
And here she is.
I don't need any erratic behaviour from her.
I'm sorry about her situation, but I've got reasons for completing this mission.
If I see her doing anything that might put us at risk, I'll bury her with my own hands.
Now go and get some rest, hero.
We wake at 6. We make for Daskasan.
I read your profile.
I don't care about what happened.
How you fight, that's what my opinion of you will be based on.
Try to keep this in mind, and stop acting as if you were on death row.
Being my commanding officer makes you feel uneasy, doesn't it?
I'll feel uneasy once you get killed for nothing, or when you act out of despair.
I don't know why you accepted this mission, but I guarantee you...
Nobody will come out of this a hero.
There are no medals for the war we are fighting, nor epitaphs.
Only victims.
The objective is more important than any of us involved in it.
Your commanding officers might be dead, Elizabeth, but you have always accomplished your missions.
If that's the outcome this time around, I'll be happy just the same.
Ok, we make camp.
I'm gonna put up some sensors.
With those, we'll know if anything tries to get near.
How many died?
A million, maybe more.
It has been one hundred years since now.
A story told by the elders, while the younger generation never seems to have time to learn.
What about the present Government?
You're a democracy.
Democracy is of no use when people are not kept informed.
We have fought for so many years against Azerbaijan in the name of the Karabakh region.
Since then, two other Governments have alternatively risen to power, but none of us really know where they want to go, or what is they do for our country.
And this new war, once again... They're keeping something from us.
I don't believe Armenia will ever be the country we dream of so much.
The Karabakh region is full of oil...
Yes, that I know.
But Karabakh is far from here, down South.
Daskasan... Daskasan doesn't count for anything.
I don't understand...
Why do you keep saying you're afraid not to find anyone in Imeret?
It is not just war.
Something different is happening here, something on the mouth of many.
That is?
The fiend of Kalcabar.
To think I'd have laughed at myself before.
I am not superstitious.
I don't believe in anything my eyes can't see.
But my family is over there, my home...
And the stories I've heard...
Entire villages found empty at dawn, and then... The people are found dead in the forest.
I still choose not to believe, but I can't think of nothing else.
We are in God's hands now...
"If God made the world, I would not want to be that God for the misery of the world would tear my heart to shreds."
Damn, you ARE cool, aren't you?
Seriously.
With your dark attitude, the wild beard, the bandana...
You'd make a good videogame character.
No shit man!
A Nintendo platformer, I'd say!
Nah, forget it.
It's just a joke, you wouldn't get it.
You're so OLD, man!
Can't say I'm surprised she's already fallen for you...
She's some woman, isn't she?
And... have you seen her ASS?
This is not the place and DEFINITELY not the time...
We are professionals here!
She and I are, at least...
Word of advice, Big Chief...
What do you think?
About what? The boy.
You don't dig him, do you?
He's unreliable.
He's one of the best, in his field...
He has no discipline.
You still have to see him in action.
He doesn't take anything seriously!
True...
While WE can't take anything with a smile...
I envy him.
He still has to grow up.
On the battlefield, either you grow up soon or you don't grow up at all!
We are professionals, the two of us.
Yeah, that we are...
Contact!
Covering 2-7-0.
Sensor's 100 meters away, we've only got a few seconds. Hurry!
How long did the sensor flash for?
About 3 seconds.
It covers a 50 meter sector.
It couldn't have been that fast.
An animal?
The sensor is calibrated on human-like thermic masses.
It must have slowed down!
At that speed it would have reached us by now.
Quiet!
What the...
Don't make any noise. Don't move, for any reason.
We'll wait 'till dawn, then we'll leave.
On your feet, you've slept enough.
Don't tell him anything. Prepare the boats, we're leaving.
Snake, everything OK?
Why did you switch your CODEC off last night?
Had a feeling it wasn't a good idea to keep it on.
You saw it too, didn't you?
If you're talking about that... thing: yes, we received your thermal scans.
What happened after that?
It left.
I have no idea what it was.
Something strange is happening out there...
Agreed.
Let's hope your father will be able to shed some light on it.
Here we are.
Imeret is just beyond that hill.
You never mentioned a radio tower!
We'll pull up here.
Let's check it out.
My home...
My family...
What's all this about?
Looks like the Senator isn't living in a village of peaceful shepherds, after all.
I was foolish to believe that was even possible.
OK. How do we proceed?
Getting in shouldn't be too hard, but we need to know whether or not the Senator is alive.
This place has seen violent conflict.
He could be dead, maybe he dropped his transmitter...
Bishop, what do you think about this?
The bug planted on his transmitter is still responding.
There's a chance he might be hiding in the big structure at the centre of that complex.
By the way, do you have any lead about what this place is?
Your guess is good as mine...
GET DOWN!
Why did he just...
I don't know.
Sniper must be in the main building.
There are probably more nearby.
The spotter is changing observation zone.
They must think he was alone.
I can see another two soldiers on the lower levels.
There's gotta be more...
And I was just starting to think we'd be able to take the Senator without a fight...
Any idea who they are?
ArmsTech's private army, most likely.
They must be waiting for someone to come and pick them up along with the Senator.
Listen up: according to Bishop, the Senator's transmitter signal is coming from the complex, probably the main tower.
The only way to get there undetected is by going through the railway viaduct.
That will lead us towards the mountains.
I need you to provide me with enemy intel.
Once I've found him, be ready to give me and the Senator some cover fire.
Understand?
Not quite.
What is it?
Look, Big Chief, if I were you I would start asking myself some questions:
Vitalij said he had been here a month ago.
How could anyone have built that monstrosity in less than a month?
Seven days...
Vitalij was here less than seven days ago.
What?
Why would he lie to us?
No idea.
If he was mentally unstable, he certainly didn't show any sign of it before...
Look. None of us know what's going on, but now is not the time to figure it out.
Our main objective is in there.
We get the Senator out, then we'll have time to go over the situation.
Who knows, maybe he'll have the answers we're looking for.
We might have been lured here on purpose!
By someone who just took a bullet in the forehead?
I've had enough of your analysis.
We don't have time right now to listen to your theories, so keep them to yourself.
That's an order.
Snake!
Do you copy?
What?
We've got armed men approaching the complex.
How many?
I can see at least twenty, but if they're coming from other directions, there could be hundreds of them.
JUBAL!
JUBAL!
Snake, there's nothing we can do to help you from here.
Damn...
Try to reach the railway!
We'll meet up there.
Oh my God...
What?
Snake, behind you!
Harrison, I've spotted a Metal Gear!
What?
It looked like a tactical unmanned model.
But it was... kinda ridden by a weird guy, some FOXHOUND-like freak.
I didn't have time to take pictures though, and I can't tell you much else at the moment.
Anyway, looks like ArmsTech is much stronger than we thought.
Snake, find my father as soon as possible!
We need him to tell us what's going on!
Right. I'm going in.
Elizabeth?
Pierre? Anyone!
Just like Vitalij said it would be.
A war so long no one actually remembers how it started.
This is not just another border skirmish. We're not equipped for a situation like this.
The North side of the complex is quieter.
If we still want to get in, I'd say that's our only hope.
More are coming.
It's now or never.
Let's go.
OK, what's your favourite strategy for infiltrating... "giant enemy towers"?
Like in the movies...
SEWAGE SYSTEM
Ok, security will be tighter from now on.
We go stealth.
Control, this is Moebius Three.
They're flanking us, we can't hold our position much longer!
Abel, this is Control.
Be ready to extract the Senator at any time.
Roger Control, heading for the Senator's room.
That's our man.
Come on.
Time to move the old man.
Not again...
Man, we should just leave this fucking place.
Who cares about him?
We do!
Looks like the entire world's dying to protect you, Senator.
Who the hell are you?
It doesn't matter.
Take what you need and follow me, I'm getting you out of here.
And where would you be taking me, precisely?
To a safe place, so you can tell us what the hell is going on in this God forsaken region.
Who sent you?
You don't look like a Government agent.
I wouldn't have expected anyone else to get involved in this.
Second wave of attack, coming from the eastern sector!
Fall back to the tower!
Fall back to the tower!
We're gonna to get trapped inside! Damn!
Senator, we don't have much time.
The only way we're going to survive is by getting out of here, now!
Alright.
Drop it!
Go, go, go!
The perimeter has been breached, we need backup at sub-level 6!
Here they are!
Tom!
What are you looking at?
Let's go!
Bring him out!
Wait for my signal.
Wait!
This is suicide!
Better to die sooner than later, Senator...
For die we must.
Come on!
Stay close to me.
There's a breach in the outer wall.
It's our only chance.
Cover me.
Go!
Snake!
Come on!
Wait here.
Come on!
RUN!
Senator, what was that complex?
Who were those people?
What the hell is going on here?
The complex is owned by ArmsTech Inc. along with everything in this region.
What's ArmsTech doing here?
Daskasan has been the neural centre of ArmsTech's activities for years now.
The Azeri Government is paid handsomely to turn a blind eye to all activities.
This is a deserted region, perfect for testing new weapons.
Like a Metal Gear?
How many others are there?
Where are they being assembled?
You'll find the answers you're looking for there, in Eldridge.
Eldridge?
Yes.
That's where my work was taking place.
That's were my life took an unexpected turn.
Follow me.
There's something I'd like you to see.
This mission just got a hell of a lot more complicated, Big Chief!
Yeah.
The blitzkrieg by this "Overnight Nation" must have something to do with Eldridge.
There's more to these events than just Metal Gears.
Whatever's going on we'll find our answers under those dark clouds.
Wow, look at those fire works over there!
Scott, hurry!
The entire fortress is about to explode, we have to... uhm... ehm... take my socks!
For God's sake who is this man?
I dunno who he is.
Check and see if he as a wallet on him...
Oh no that's just his throat.
Been a right while then, what... We just ...
What was that? Oh nothing.
Come on!
That's porn.
You couldn't have just thrown it to me?
God it's right in the face...
It fricken stings!
That's poooorn...
Ok, let's check this out...
Wait... this is a guy and a guy...
NOOOOO!
Hey Gary!
What's this button do over here?
Don't press it... don't press it!
OH MY GOOOOOOD!
Oh, crap!
And tonight at 10, we'll show you just how cream can...
Acchhk... Sorry, got a bug in my mouth.
And we'll be continuing on to our news coverage.
Hey Mom, quick question, my edible underwear, where...
Ah, nevermind, I think I found it.
Mmm, strawberry, so good.
Just what kind of phenomena?
Ducks signed non-aggression pacts with China.
Plaid became the new fashion.
Snakes organized their own Union in protest of Snake Eater.
And butter was elected to the highest possible office available.
In other words, this shit is fucked up.
Yo, let's get this motherfucking Snake off of this motherfucking plane!
Da fuuuuck.
That is... Quite... An...
Unprecedented atmospheric event. As well as being the reason... OK, fuck this.
There's a typhoon, it's messing shit up, you can't do shit, so... shut up.
And Snake...
You're really pretty cute!
What are you saying!
?
No, she's been delisted due to disciplinary reasons...
*Gasps* Sorry, I forgot my asthma inhaler.
Ok guys, you've been talking long enough...
Get the fuck out!
You've been wanting a movie all your life Snake.
This time... You can finally have one.
Fuck yeah!
AWWGHHH MY EYES!
Won't you let me stand on your head? !
Let's roooooock!
Wanna get laid?
Uhm... It's hooker time.
Come on Pierre!
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream... Elizabeth!
Row row row your boat, gently down the stream... Come on!
Come on, Lizzy, come on!
We are in God's hands now.
Did you know that a pig's orgasm can last for over 30 minutes?
That's 30 whole minutes!
How could you do anything else all day?
No wonder they sleep so much.
Word of advice big chief...
Live!
Oh my God hottness, I wanna bang you!
Ok, how do we proceed?
Mm? Oh sorry I was distracted.
There's a girl with huge... objectives in the lower hand window.
To the mall!
THE MAAAAALL!
YEAHHHHH GET OVER 25% OFF!
Hello?
Yes?
I'm happy with my life insurance!
Yeah?
Why are we standing in front of a window during wartime like this?
Uhm... Not sure.
Giggidy!
*gasp* Oh my God guys, check it out, it's Santa Claus!
Are you Solid Snake?
You're on my naughty list this year.
You killed 17 people just last month.
You're getting a lump of coal.
Don't worry Senator, I have super powers.
For I am... the Flash!
BROADSWOOOOORD!
Garugamesh!
Hey Big Chief, don't you think this is ending a lot like the Two Towers?
Naaaaaah!
Don't worry, Pierre.
Ok, bye!
Are you ok?
Yeah, are you?
This night was rough.
- Did you come to take care of me?
- Is there an option?
Yeah.
What most people do when they're around me.
- Leave.
- No way.
Life would just be too predictable.
- How do I look?
- Good.
You suck at lying.
But I'm glad you tried.
Rise and shine, darling.
I'm heading out for today and I might not be home tonight.
Really, Ashley.
I tolerate your playmates, but do they have to be here in the morning?
I'm sorry, I just fell asleep.
You remember my friend Spencer, right mom?
Right.
Look hon, I can't leave you if you insist on bringing home this kinda friends.
- Actually I just came to take care of her.
- And I'm sure you did that very well.
- Mom, could you please try and be nice?
- Oh I have been.
To Paige who stole my credit card.
To Elizabeth who passed out eating my valium.
Then there was the one with the piercings.
She moved in and we had to have help to get rid off her.
There, this ought to cover you to get home.
Ciao.
I'm so sorry.
It's how it is every morning?
No, that only happens once a month, when I see her.
Did you really sleep with all those girls?
Those are just the ones she found out about.
They never meant anything.
That makes it better.
Better watch out, Mom and Dad are back They know you were gone all night.
You sound almost happy about that.
- You're okay, Spencer?
- Yeah, I'm fine?
Ashley isn't feeling too good though.
Ashley?
you were supposed to be with Aiden.
Forget it, Glenn, your stupid plan didn't work.
Is it too much to ask for a phone call?
Whether we're here or not we deserve to know where you are and if you're okay.
- Not to mention you missed church.
- I'm sorry I spent the night at Ashley's.
I didn't think you and dad would be back so early.
Now we know you don't go to mass unless we make you.
Sorry.
Spencer.
Don't you see I'm worried about you?
Ever since we moved here, you've changed.
What am I supposed to do?
Stay the same?
- Spencer, list...
- No, dad.
You know what?
Glenn goes out every night.
And nobody says anything.
And then I go out to help a friend and get the Inquisition?
A little double standard, don't you think?
- It's that girl, I've told you.
- Here we go again.
You know what?
Her name is Ashley, Ashley.
Why won't you ever say her name?
You want me to say her name?
I'll say her name.
- You are not allowed to see Ashley.
- What?
Why?
Because she's a bad influence.
I am telling you, you are forbidden to see Ashley.
How are you gonna stop me?
You're never home.
Paula.
What is wrong with you?
You're on the edge, here
Don't you dare make this about me.
This is about our daughter.
And this relationship she's having with that Ashley.
Don't you see you're letting it drive a wedge between you and Spencer?
Really?
Maybe I should go away and you'll deal with it, cause you obviously know best.
You do what you have to do.
I'm sick and tired of following you and not really knowing why.
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking your lifeline.
I wanna know if you're gonna be around for a while.
Get a room!
Since when did this become the island of Lesbos?
It's hard to get pissed when she makes a geography joke.
I wonder if she even knows what it means.
I know her evil minions don't.
you know you're right.
We're gonna be late for class.
I'm glad your folks were fighting.
Cause, I mean, it normals them up.
My mom loves a good fight with my dad.
She says it's all about the make up sex.
Thanks for the image.
Now I'll never be able to have dinner at your house!
I called her.
My mom.
I spoke to her.
You think I should go see her?
Only if you need to.
With no expectations on who or how she'll be.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Maybe I'll learn something.
Maybe when she sees me she'll want to know about me.
Maybe you need to tell her that you are a... wonderful, talented, smart black man that forgives her.
I know it'll help you whether it changes her or not.
Duke, that's who that was.
And they are talking of a full ride.
All I have to do is stay healthy and keep putting the ball in the hoop.
That's good baby.
Congratulations.
Good?
It's freaking awesome.
That's the place to be.
Their team is always in the final four.
We're talking about national TV just to see your man shoot the rock.
Glenn Carlin, nothing but net, the crowd goes wild... ahhhh!
Hey baby, I mean.
Aren't you happy?
This isn't what you wanted?
For us, for me?
Of course I'm happy for you. It's just...
Now I have to start thinking of what it's gonna be like without you.
Without me?
Long distance relationships are really hard.
I mean, come on, you didn't keep a girlfriend in Ohio when you moved here?
Right.
- Maybe you can come with me.
- I would love that.
But I don't know about moving out there just to be with you.
Unless we are married.
Married?
I think I should probably just be focusing on playing ball and school right now.
I would never pressure you, I mean, this is an opportunity of a lifetime.
I just think we should be honest on how this is gonna affect us.
If there is an "us".
Hey, we don't have to figure this out today
Why don't you drive me home and we'll celebrate?
My mom's out of the house.
I wish my parents weren't acting like complete freaks.
Suspicious, controlling.
I wish I didn't care.
I have a lot of experience is that area.
It's not you, it's totally them.
Parents are not rational people.
Something happens when you get older.
I think it's hormones.
hey focus on you so much so they don't have to focus on themselves and all their crap.
Thanks.
I have to go.
Hey, next time you get polluted, you need to let someone else drive.
- You scared me, man.
- But I'm still here.
Black eye, ain't nothing going to stop me, baby.
You must be high on your meds.
We'll catch you later.
- Take it easy, Boz.
- Stay up, Clay, player.
That brother has to learn to think.
Just cause he lives now he thinks he's invincible.
He Sean, I need to borrow your car.
I know you just got it, I promise I'll be careful.
- Cool, just don't wreck my ride. - Thanks.
- You're not gonna ask me why?
- You're gonna go see your mom.
What do you think?
It's not about what I think.
It's what you think.
See, you're looking for something, maybe you will find it in that woman.
Thanks, man.
I just need some time, okay?
I need some distance.
I think we ought to the kids to tell them what's going on.
Okay.
Here are the club sodas.
I'll just talk to myself.
Maybe meet 2 new girls to get messed up in the head with.
What is up with you, Ashley?
Look, sometimes you're pulling me close to you.
And then I try to make a step towards you and you close up and move away.
Exactly.
Can you give us a minute?
Sure.
I'll be right over here if either one of you guys decide to straighten up.
Cute.
Do you want that life?
Stupid little comment about what you are and how you feel?
So I learned to laugh most things off, cause it hurts too much to do anything else.
You know what?
I can't just be your friend, Ashley.
It has to be more than that or I'm out of your life.
I need to figure out mine.
What do I do about Spencer?
Don't ask me, I'm the only one in the school not hooking up.
Yeah but you alone, this gives you a certain clarity.
What do I do?
Do you wanna be with her?
I don't know.
What if I scare her away?
I think you're the one who's afraid.
- No.
I know from experience that you're the one that does the heartbreaking.
Maybe...
Maybe you're afraid that Spencer is the one that's gonna break yours.
What are you thinking?
That you'd make a great girl.
You sucked today, Carlin.
You aren't at Duke yet, alright?
We still got games to win and a whole season next year, so don't blow it
Thanks man, it's just a bad day.
Yeah, I had one of those the day you showed up.
Funny.
But I mean, you still have college opportunity, right?
Yeah I mean, I'm not too worried.
Although I'm not gonna lie, it was a lot better before you got here.
And I was better.
My life was a lot better before I got here too.
Not possible.
You got game, you got a hot girl.
You're living a dream.
- Yeah, about the girl.
- Yeah I know, she's a handful.
You know, when you two were together. Did she ever pressure you?
To play better, treat her better, cement the relationship.
All the time.
That's part of what makes her so... hot.
With all due respect to a lady.
Hello.
Are you Mrs. Garrison?
Yeah, yeah, Cecily.
- Are you Clay?
I'm Clay Carlin and I think I'm your son.
Sit down.
So, tell me about yourself.
Well, I'm a junior in high school.
Actually I love school, I'm doing very well.
I live in California with my adopting parents.
I have a brother and a sister.
Whole family.
How did you end up in Nevada?
Well, I needed to leave my life in Cincinnati.
You know?
Too many memories.
Too many people looking down on me.
So I left school and I started working my way West.
I liked the weather here, so I stayed.
You wanna ask me something?
Yes.
How could you just give up your son?
What do you want?
I was fifteen.
Fifteen.
I couldn't raise a child.
That's it?
- Did you even tried to figure it out?
- What did you come here expecting to find?
You know what?
I just thought I'd find some missing piece to the puzzle.
Well you did, okay?
I'm sorry if it's not the piece that you wanted to find.
- Yeah, this was a waste of time.
- Well it's not for me.
Because I got to meet my son.
And I know I made the right decision.
For you.
For you.
It was right for you.
Over here, over here.
Watch it man.
I want you and mom to be okay.
I know you do.
So do I.
But your mom and I might need to take a little break from each other.
- Get things back on track.
- You mean splitting up?
How does that get things back on track?
Maybe we'll remember why we get together in the first place.
We'll figure it out.
What about you?
You're okay?
I don't know.
Spencer.
You're my daughter.
I love you so very very much, no matter who you are.
Are you expecting someone?
Hi.
- It's good to see you, Ashley.
- Nice to see you too, Mr. C.
Send him to X-ray and then in ER3.
Glenn, can you move your knee at all?
Oh God it hurts.
I can't even bend it.
Mom, will I be able to play again?
Honey, don't worry about that.
Let's just getting you fix up, okay?
So?
So...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for the "come here, go away" trip I've been putting you through.
Okay.
Why would you do that?
Because I want you.
And I don't wanna hurt you.
I can take care of myself.
And with some left over to take care of you.
Come to my place tonight.
Mom's gonna be in the Costa for a couple of days.
Okay.
Sir...
This is a bar.
It ain't a place for brats like you. Oh?
For a bar, I seem to smell more blood than alcohol.
Well, whatever.
At any rate, I heard an interesting rumor.
They say there's a stinky bar around here full of thugs.
Apparently they'd take your lives over your money.
Funny, don't you think?
Yeah, the usual.
The raw clam and garlic potato mix special.
It's urgent.
What?
Don't worry about details. I'll pay you everything soon. Yeah.
No olives, and I want a size L. Don't you forget.
You listening, Dante?
I said I'm studying. I may be a handyman but no way I'm looking after brats.
Brat?
Sorry, missy.
How bout I give you ten years before I go out on a date with you?
I'll reject you in ten seconds.
Well, just listen Dante.
She's not any girl.
She's Patty Lowell, a Cinderella who'll inherit the Lowell family's property. Pretty shabby for a Cinderella, if you ask me.
That's because she's lived her life in a downtown orphanage.
I see.
A Cinderella who's lost her spell. Just the opposite actually.
The head of the Lowell family passed away recently.
And from his will it was revealed that he has a love-child. And that's Patty.
That's right.
In other words, it's only after then will her spell be ready.
In that case, how about I hire you as my servant?
Right.
Well, in short, the client wants you to escort her to the Lowell mansion by 18:00 tomorrow.
I told Andy not to bring you any more pizzas till you pay off all your bills.
Not again?
If you win, I'll pay all your bills.
If you lose...
Fine, I get it.
Dante.
You forgot this.
Don't you have a live concert?
Concert?
See ya, I'm counting on you.
I'll come to your concert next time.
After all, no one else comes, right?
Thanks, but my show's adults only.
So the lady in the photo, she's coming, isn't she? Photo?
Well... at any rate, you should get a new car.
This one has totally no mood at all!
It's dirty, it's smelly and it's all worn.
Listen okay?
The important thing to a girl about a car, Is not the destination but the journey itself.
Dante the girl's life... is MINE!
Hey, are you listening?
What are you doing?
What's going on? ! That was dangerous!
What're you gonna do if I died? ! Can't you do something, bro?
Aren't you a lawyer?
There's nothing I can do.
That letter clearly states that if Patty Lowell does indeed exist, all the inheritance will go to her.
-No shit!
-Relax, brother.
If that letter's genuine, Patty Lowell will arrive at this mansion tomorrow at 6pm.
That's precisely why I'm worried!
It'll be exactly one week by 6pm tomorrow!
"All inheritance will be passed on to Patty Lowell upon the confirmation of her existence within a week from my death."
Who would think such an earnest man would have a love-child...
I'm surprised you can make that face.
Is it a boy?
She's way prettier than your girlfriend, I tell you!
But I don't remember anything.
My mom, I heard from the head that she died of illness when I was a baby.
That's why I don't recall anything about my mom, nothing at all.
Oh, what a pretty lady.
Is that your mother?
You look very pretty yourself.
Is this seat available?
Dude, the whole place's empty.
-Please.
-Thank you. I hope it isn't any trouble.
It's no trouble, but I can't guarantee your life.
What do you mean by that!
I don't get it.
What could happen to anyone just by sitting beside m-
What did I tell you?
Mom...
Pummeled to death, huh.
-Don't tell me you... -This way!
What the...
Hey you!
Tell me what happened.
All right, how bout this.
This train was in the tunnel for about ten seconds.
In that time, the passengers were only those three, the girl and myself.
Oh, this corpse too. That totals to six people.
First, the old man... nah, can't be him.
The couple over there were having fun in the dark.
And the kid's as you see.
So you--
Huh uh. There's one more person.
Or should I say, demon?
Who killed that man?
Who knows? A demon.
He was killed by a demon wasn't he?
Am I being targeted by demons too?
Dante!
We're leaving.
You really like that picture, don't you?
Yes I do.
For some reason I feel calm when I look at it.
That's right.
I'll take the family's gallery when we split up our inheritance.
I'll take cash.
Hey hey, it's not even--
I know. It's only just in case...
Just in case.
Even demons...
Welcome...
I'll take the cheapest room.
Doesn't matter if it's shady.
We'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
One adult and one kid.
She's not a kid, she's a little missy. What are you doing?
Let's go sleep already.
-Mom...
-Huh? Mom...
Mister!
Yes...?
What is it...? This lady, where can I see her?
Hey hey, your mom died.
Let's go.
Damn, this place chills.
You should sleep soon.
We're leaving early tomorrow.
My mom, she didn't really die of illness.
She went missing. I happened to hear the head talking about it.
He said that demons were after my mom, and so she left me at an orphanage to keep me safe.
My mom died!
Am I gonna get killed too?
Who knows?
You know, I don't care about inheritance or successions.
But, if I do get some money, all I want is to buy everyone at the orphanage lots of clothes and food.
But that's not what we want.
We just want to see our mother and father, above all.
You must be laughing, right?
No.
Everyone wants to see their parents. Dante...
Okay.
Man, I heard it's getting dangerous that there're four big bosses in the demon world fighting for power.
Who hired you?
Who hired you to kill Patty?
Lemme guess, the Lowell guys?
It has to be someone who'd get upset if Patty gets the inheritance, right?
I don't know.
I'm just an underling.
They don't tell me a thing.
Hmm...
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy, I've missed you!
I'm so sorry, Patty.
I'll never leave you alone again.
Mommy.
Because you're going to die this instant!
Come here, let mommy kill you!
From here on it's adults only.
Miss, I'm sorry but it's time to die.
You see, they'll promise me a handsome reward if I kill you.
Scram.
Time's up.
We did it, bro!
-Sir, you have a guest. -A guest?
Thank you.
Hi. Who might you be?
Auw, come on. I'm Patty Lowell.
I thought it was a kid! That's a fake, of course.
I considered all the possible situations I might be facing and luckily,
I quickly found a kid with the same name.
I merely made it so that you have all your attention on her.
Thanks to that I had a wonderful journey. So, let's hurry up and finish the procedure, shall we?
I'm afraid that won't do, Miss Patty Lowell.
As a lawyer I must consider, that you gave up your inheritance and succession as of 6pm today, even if you were just a second late.
Oh but the letter states that that'll happen a week from father's death.
Father died exactly a week ago at 6:28. Look, I made it in time after all.
I hope my driver's license is enough for identification?
No, it is no longer necessary. What do you mean?
Because there will be no confirmation of Patty Lowell's existence!
The one who hired me to guard Patty. Is that how you atone for your sins?
You may have a pretty face but you're worse than that demon over there.
I wouldn't have hesitated to kill you if you were one.
At this rate I'd be pissed if I don't do something.
Time to play.
It's showtime!
Wait! Please wait!
Please let me adopt that child.
It's the least I can do to atone.
I received compensation. -Compensation?
Compensation for traumatizing and showing a little girl the world of ugly adults.
I see. So that dress is your compensation?
Yup! I also got everyone's share of clothes and food at the orphanage.
It's a total of three truckloads!
That's good to hear.
Morrison?
Didn't see you coming. Yeah.
Huh?
Hey, my strawberry sundae should be here by now.
Oh, you mean that?
My strawberry sundae!
Patty!
Why are you here? !
No, more importantly...
The astronomers are assembled in a large hall embellished with instruments.
The president and members of the committee enter.
Everybody takes his seat.
Entrance of six man-servants carrying the telescopes of the astronomers.
The scheme is approved by many.
But one member violently opposes same.
After some argument, the president throws his papers and books at his head.
Upon order being restored, the trip proposed by the president is voted by acclimation.
We enter the interior of the workshop where smiths, mechanics, weighers, carpenters, upholsterers, et cetera are working hard at the completion of the machine.
Micromegas accidentally falls into a tub of nitric acid.
A workman informs the astronomers that if they would ascend to the roof, they will witness a splendid spectacle: the casting of the gun.
Against the horizon, the chimneys are seen belching forth volumes of smoke.
Suddenly, the flag is hoisted.
At the signal, a mass of molten steel is directed from each furnace into the mold for the gun.
The mold pours forth flames and vapor.
On the top of the roofs of the town, pompous preparations have been made.
The shell is in position, ready to receive the travelers.
These arrive respond to the acclamations of the crowd and finally enter the shell.
A marine closes the bridge through which they have passed.
A number of gunners are pushing the shell up an incline into the mouth of the gun.
The bridge is closed.
Everyone is waiting for the signal which starts the shell on its voyage.
An officer gives the signal.
The gun is fired and the shell disappears into space.
The shell coming closer every minute, the moon magnifies rapidly until finally it attains colossal dimensions.
The shell comes down with a crash.
The astronomers get out and are delighted at the landscape which is new to them.
Against the horizon, the Earth is rising slowly into space illuminating the picture with a fantastic light.
Just as they are about to explore, an explosion throws the unfortunate men violently in all directions.
The astronomers show signs of fatigue after the rough trip they have just had.
They stretch themselves out on the ground and go to sleep.
Seven gigantic stars representing the Great Bear appear slowly, and out of the stars come faces of women who seem annoyed at the presence of these intruders in the moon.
Then, the stars are replaced by a lovely vision of Phoebes on the crescent, of Saturn in his globe and of charming young girls holding up a star.
They decide to punish the terrestrials in an exemplary manner.
By order of Phoebes, snow is falling from all quarters, covering the ground with its white coat. The cold becomes unbearable. So the unfortunate voyagers wake up half-frozen.
They decide without hesitation and in spite of the danger to descend into the interior of the great crater in which they disappear one-by-one whilst the snowstorm is still raging.
The astronomers arrive into the interior of a most curious grotto filled with enormous mushrooms of every kind.
One of them opens his umbrella to compare its size with the mushroom, but the umbrella suddenly takes root and transforming itself into a mushroom starts growing attaining gigantic proportions.
The astronomers suddenly notice strange beings coming out from underneath the mushrooms while making singular contortions.
These are the Selenites, or inhabitants of the Moon.
A fantastical being rushes on an astronomer who defends himself and with a stroke of his umbrella the Selenite bursts into a thousand pieces.
But the Selenites are arriving in numbers.
The astronomers are captured, bound and taken to the palace of the King of the Selenites.
On a splendid throne, surrounded by living stars, the Selenite king is seated.
President Barbenfouillis makes a dash for the King of the Selenites and lifting him like a feather throws him violently on the ground.
The astronomers run away in the midst of the general disorder.
The Selenite army is pursuing them.
The astronomers run at full speed turning around each time they are pressed too closely and reducing the fragile beings to dust.
At last, the astronomers have found the shell and quickly shut themselves in the interior.
Thanks to the advance, they have succeeded in getting over their adversaries.
Only one, the president, has been left behind.
He rushes to the rope which hangs from the point of the shell and letting himself slide down the rope he gives it an impetus which causes the shell to fall off the edge of the moon.
The shell falls with sickening rapidity.
The sea appears.
The shell balances and thanks to the hermetically sealed air in its interior rises slowly to the surface.
The shell is picked up by a steamer which tows it to port.
First, state your name, age, and the present condition of your health, and whether in your condition you could travel to attend in person to Beaver, the court now sitting there.
I am Brigham Young.
I am in my 75th year.
It would be a great risk to both my health and life for me to travel to Beaver at this time.
Because I am, and have been for some time, an invalid.
Second, what office, either ecclesiastical, civil or military, did you hold in the year 1857?
I was Governor of the Territory, ex-officio Superintendent to Indian Affairs, and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the year 1857.
The last time I was here, I was six months old,
They say you don't remember things at that age, but I remember feelings,
I remember the feel of wooden wagon wheels bouncing over the rocky ground,
I remember the feel of horse hooves as they pounded across the meadow,
I remember the feelings of love that flowed through everyone on that wagon train,
It felt special,
Two different worlds met on this spot, one of love, the other of hate,
-What is it?
-Riders.
Looks like six of them.
Let's go see who we have.
Greetings.
I'm Captain Alexander Fancher, and this is Captain John Baker.
Perhaps you could tell us, are we close to the supply station?
There is no supply station.
We were told there was a supply station near here.
No supply station.
Best if you keep going.
We need supplies, which we will happily pay for, and a resting spot where we can graze and water our livestock.
We have nothing to sell.
We passed rich fields being cultivated all across this territory,
-yet you say you have nothing to sell us.
-That's right.
We don't have enough supplies to get us to California.
Is there a problem, Alexander?
-Seems they don't like strangers.
-Just making sure that you do not stop here.
We're willing to pay top dollar.
-Money is the root of all evil.
-What about charity and mercy?
Our livestock need to graze and water.
Our people need rest.
You should have thought about that before.
Name's General Jacob Samuelson, and these are my sons, Jonathan and Micah.
Folks around here call me the Bishop or the General.
I'm the Bishop of the Church, the General of the local militia, and the Mayor all rolled into one.
I'm Captain Alexander Fancher, one of the leaders of this wagon train.
This is Captain Baker, Nancy Dunlap.
Well, these people here are telling us to move along.
We were hoping to buy provisions and water and graze our livestock.
We don't come begging.
We're willing to pay.
Not an unreasonable request.
We need to show some Christian charity here, now don't we?
Thank goodness.
The men here sometimes get a little excited.
We've had many problems with emigrants using this trail.
I'm sorry to hear that.
So you understand, we need to check you out before we decide whether to help you or not.
Of course.
We have nothing to hide.
You stay here.
My sons and I will look things over.
That's a fine animal you're on, sir.
This is One Eyed Blaze.
He's my pride and joy.
-Must be worth a pretty penny.
-Two thousand, that's no lie.
Now, what fool would pay so much for a horse?
A breeding or a gaming man, sir.
You interested in horses, son?
We have the best horses west of the Mississippi with us.
Well, there's nothing here that looks menacing.
You all seem to be good Christian men and women.
Thank you, Bishop.
Does this mean you'll let us stay here and rest awhile?
First, let me ask where you people are from.
Most of us are from Arkansas, some of us are from Missouri.
Missouri?
Our people need rest, Bishop.
We'll pay double with American Gold Eagles.
No, of course not.
-One should not pay for what God provides.
-Thank you.
My men will direct you to a place not very far from here where you can camp for no more than two weeks.
You'll be safe from the hostile Indians there.
-Thank you.
Thank you very much, Bishop.
-Good day.
Did you see those horses?
Weren't they something?
I've never seen horses like that before.
Two thousand dollars for a horse!
A man could have a mansion with that kind of money!
Those horses are going to be used for gambling.
Gambling is a sin.
Some of them come from Missouri and Arkansas.
I want you to keep an eye on the emigrants.
We need to find out more about them.
-We will.
-Yes, Father.
I want to know every detail.
There's no telling what could be important.
"The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man.
"All that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God."
Put the horses and wagon away.
Dinner is in exactly one hour.
Don't be late.
Micah, I expect you and your new wives to be on time.
No excuses.
-Yes, sir.
-You spend too much time with them.
The Prophet recommends that every man should have at least three wives.
Maybe you should take another one.
What are you smiling at?
-You don't even have a single wife yet.
-He's particular.
Too particular if you ask me.
Here, let me take her.
Emily, you've been a godsend since my Jenny died.
Well, you know, we've all got to help one another, Robert.
You know, the baby needs a mother.
Let us give thanks to the Lord.
We thank you for the food we eat, the shelter that keeps us dry, the clothes that keep us warm.
Thank you for this beautiful place for us to rest, and for the animals to feed and drink.
We thank you for delivering the Gentiles into our hands.
Bless the Bishop and his family for allowing us to stay.
Surely these people are cursed beyond hope of redemption.
Thank you for showing the light of Christian charity to those who doubted our motives for staying in this glorious place.
Cursed are the Gentile dogs who allow abominations like that woman in pants who carries a gun.
Curse all the people from Missouri who drove us from our land ...in Jesus' name.
May these children of Satan go to hell!
Amen.
"As he rode along, he wondered what he would do if he came face to face.
"He had a lot of things..."
A word with you, Captain Fancher?
In private, if you please.
-How long do you plan to stay here?
-The Bishop has allowed us two weeks.
Two weeks?
We need that time for our people to rest, the animals to get their bellies full, their strength back.
I have a bad feeling about this place.
It isn't safe.
And I think we should move on as soon as possible.
The Bishop himself said we'd be safe here.
I know, but I don't like it.
I have children that depend upon me.
As do I.
I can't help it.
Since Lorenzo got sick, I just worry all the time.
My children have only me to depend upon.
Nancy, you're not alone.
You've got an entire wagon train here with you.
Now, the Bishop seems to have an understanding with the Indians, and...
Well, I believe we're safe here.
It's not the Indians I worry about.
How long will you be gone, Father?
Two days.
Jonathan, you're the eldest.
You'll be responsible.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
I'm sure.
Would you like me to do as you suggested and check up on the emigrants?
You're awfully eager to follow my suggestions.
I'd like to get another look at the horses.
Are you sure that's all you want to get a look at?
Watch them closely.
I want to know what they're up to.
What would you like me to do?
You watch your brother.
-What are you doing?
-Watching you.
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.
-You're the Bishop's son.
-Yes, sir, I'm Jonathan.
-Beautiful day.
-Yes, sir.
Sure.
-Are you out for a morning ride, are you?
-No, sir.
The truth is, I was admiring your horses yesterday, and I was hoping to get a closer look at them, if that's okay by you.
Well, let's ride on down and get you that closer look.
I'm always proud to show off our horses.
-You like horses, do you?
-Yes, sir.
It seems I have a way with them.
-These are all mares?
-Brood mares.
Most of them are due in the spring.
When we get to California, we should have a fine crop of babies.
-I've never seen horses like this before.
-And you probably never will.
These horses are Kentucky's finest.
We plan to start horse racing when we get to California.
Give those miners something to do besides drinking and whoring.
Why is that horse tied away from the others?
He's mean, unmanageable, doesn't like anybody.
I heard he was kept in a stall for a whole year and never let out while his owners tried to decide what to do with him.
-Are you planning on racing him?
-No, no, he's unridable.
Then why do you keep him?
For breeding.
He'll make a great sire, one day.
He's got the finest bloodlines, and he runs like the wind.
I'm telling you, I swear my brother knows how to talk to horses.
Very impressive.
Ma'am.
Begging your pardon.
That was quite impressive, Mr. Samuelson.
-Jonathan.
My name is Jonathan.
-Emily.
I'm Emily.
I saw you on the first day.
I was riding in my father's carriage.
I remember.
And I'm Micah.
Mr. Talkative's brother.
Nice to meet you, Micah.
-So, do all animals like you?
-Most, I guess.
Perhaps you'd like to try and ride him?
He's magnificent.
Captain Fancher, why don't you let Jonathan try to ride him?
I would say that's Jonathan's decision.
I'll warn you though, he's thrown every rider that's tried.
-Mr. Samuelson?
-Jonathan.
Please, call me Jonathan.
-Jonathan.
-I'll need a corral.
A one without corners so he won't feel confined.
I think we can provide that.
Come back tomorrow in the morning, you can have a go at him.
We are earnestly seeking to expose the vicious principles of Joseph Smith and those who practice the same abominations and whoredoms.
Joseph Smith has ordered us to destroy everything.
He is the voice of God.
Burn the papers.
Burn the papers.
Burn everything.
We will trample down our enemies and make it one gore of blood from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean.
I will be to this generation a second Mohammed, whose motto in treating for peace was "The Al-Qur'an or the sword."
So shall it eventually be with us, Joseph Smith or the sword!
Burn.
Let their lies burn.
Why does Joseph Smith need protection?
You're supposed to be a general, or a king?
-I heard you got 40 wives.
-King Smith!
I told you that Joseph Smith meant trouble.
It's probably those Missourians.
They hate him.
There must be 100 people down there.
We gotta get back downstairs.
You stay put.
We will never leave you or forsake you.
Brother Hyrum!
Joseph Smith is dead!
Joseph Smith is dead!
Here he comes.
-Mr. Samuelson, good morning.
-Good morning, Captain Fancher.
-What have you done to him?
-He's ready to go if you are.
Now, I'll hold him while you mount.
You let me know when you're ready, I'll pull that blindfold.
That won't be necessary.
Okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Steady.
Easy boy.
It's okay.
Okay.
Here you go, pal.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Good boy, good boy. That's it.
Come on.
You listen to me now.
Now, you're listening to me now.
Come on, good boy.
That's it.
Come on.
We're gonna be a good team.
I think that boy does speak horse.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Good morning, Jonathan.
Here we go.
I'm gonna get up on you now.
Good boy.
That's it, good boy.
Okay, you ready?
Here we go.
It's okay.
We're still partners.
Okay.
Here we go.
Good boy.
Good boy. There you go.
Hey, we're buddies.
Joseph Smith himself ordered a company of Danites to put right physically that which is not right, and to cleanse the Church of very great evils.
I have no wife whom I love so well that I would not put a javelin through her heart for lying with my brother, and I would do so with clean hands.
There are sins that men commit for which they cannot attain forgiveness in this world,
or in that which is to come.
And if their eyes were open to their true condition, they would be perfectly willing to have their blood spilt upon the ground to atone for their sins,
If there is a person here that has committed a sin that he knows will deprive him of that exaltation which he desires, and he cannot attain to it without the shedding of his blood to atone for that sin, and be saved and exalted with the gods,
they would say,
"Shed my blood that I may be saved "and exalted with the gods!"
You've done wonders with him.
Good boy.
No, he does most of the work.
I just hang on.
You two look like you've been together forever.
You have a beautiful baby.
Thank you, but she isn't mine.
Her mother died at childbirth.
So, I'm just helping the other women and Robert take care of her.
And she's doing a wonderful job of it.
I couldn't survive without her.
Can you believe what Jonathan has been able to do with the stallion?
It's impressive.
But I'd like to see what happens when you take him outside the confines of this little corral.
President Buchanan has sent thousands of troops which are on their way here to kill all the Indians and all the Mormons.
-It's outrageous.
-Outrageous.
President Buchanan means to remove me as Governor and give the kingdom to the Mericats.
I will try to take care of number one, and if it is wicked for me to try to preserve myself,
I shall persist in it, for I am intending to take care of myself.
Hell cannot remove me.
-Amen.
-Amen.
-I am still your Governor.
-Glory to God!
I will still rule this people until God himself permits another to take my place.
Hallelujah!
I'm declaring martial law.
We will not be run out.
This time, we will stand and fight.
I am the voice of God, and anyone who doesn't like it will be hewn down.
God has revealed to me that I have the right and the power to call down curses on anyone who tries to invade our lands.
-Therefore, I curse the Gentiles.
-Amen.
You like him?
He's a beautiful horse.
With the right handling, he'll be a great horse.
I'm glad you think so, because he's yours to keep.
I can't accept such a gift.
Boy, that horse belongs to you.
He was yours the moment you laid eyes on each other.
And it wouldn't be fair for me to stop love at first sight, now would it?
Thank you, sir.
You're very generous.
No more generous than your father has been to us.
Thank you, sir.
-Thank you very much.
-You're most welcome.
I don't know how to accept such a fine gift.
Well, I think, as the Captain said, I think he was yours the moment you laid eyes on each other.
Love at first sight.
Do you believe in that?
I don't know.
It happened to my parents.
My mother always likes to say it was God's plan for their lives, that it was their destiny to be together.
Do you believe in destiny?
You're different.
I mean, I've never met anyone like you before.
You haven't?
A lot of people say it's because I'm a pastor's daughter, which... I really don't like it.
It makes me feel like a misfit.
I've never really been around Gentiles before.
Gentiles?
What do you mean by that?
You're not Jewish.
It's just what we call you people.
You people?
What do you mean by you people?
It's just a manner of speaking.
You know, different parts of the country have different ways of saying things.
You know?
I suppose, Biblically speaking, you're correct.
But then that would make you a Gentile, too.
Actually, I like that you're different from the other girls around here.
How am I different?
Well, for a start, you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen.
Well, I like that.
And you speak your mind.
You're not afraid to tell people what you think.
Why is that different?
A lot of the women around here speak their mind.
I mean, look at Nancy.
She's much more outspoken than I am.
You mean the woman who wears the pants and carries the gun?
-Yes.
-My father thinks she's an abomination.
Does he?
He's not different from the rest of the men around here.
And I don't see other women in the wagon train wearing pants or carrying guns.
I mean, so what do they think about her?
It's a free country.
She can do what she pleases.
Why would your father care about something like that?
What difference does it make to him?
It's just the way he is.
A lot of things bother him.
"Why look at the mote in your brother's eye when there is a beam in yours?"
-What?
-Jesus said that in Matthew.
It sounds as though your father is always looking for the motes in other people's eyes.
He's the Bishop.
I mean, it's his job.
He has to keep people in line.
What does your father do?
My father says, "Judge not, lest ye be judged."
Jesus said that, too.
How does he keep control?
How does he punish the sinners?
He doesn't punish sinners.
Their sins are between them and God.
Will I see you again?
Even if the sun doesn't rise.
A wagon train from Missouri and Arkansas is camped at the Mountain Meadows.
They have 500 head of prize beef, a choice herd of Kentucky racehorses, Kentucky muzzleloaders, a large stockpile of ammunition and a well-guarded wagon with a trunk that is said to be full of gold.
I hear some of them are Missouri wildcats who brag about killing Joseph Smith and carry the very gun that killed him.
They say that they will join the army and kill Brigham Young, all the apostles, and every damned Mormon man, woman and child.
They have no pass to go through our country.
No man has the right to go through our lands without a pass.
They could be killed as common enemies.
The Paiutes and the brethren must stick together for the Mericats plan to kill us all.
We have led the Mericats to the Mountain Meadows.
It's the perfect place for an ambush and a siege.
A crown of celestial glory and eternal joy is the reward of those who are faithful and willingly obey.
We are gathered here to build up the kingdom of God.
It exalts God that he has planted this people in a place that's not desired by the wicked.
Until this moment, I have protected emigrants who have passed through this territory, but now...
Now I will loose the Indians upon them!
And if any miserable scoundrel comes here to our Zion, cut his throat.
We take a solemn oath to never discuss this, even among ourselves,
and promise to keep the whole matter secret from every human being.
-Amen.
-Amen.
"Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous.
"Praise is comely for the upright.
Praise the Lord with heart."
You should be careful, Emily.
These people are different.
I find him interesting.
I know.
-Where are you going?
-To the river to bathe.
-ls that safe?
-Safer then one more day with the smell.
Good night.
Emily.
No good will come of this.
Seems like a lot of people have opinions about things which are none of their business, Robert.
We're leaving in a week and your heart will still be here.
Well, maybe I will stay with my heart.
And be one of his many wives?
At least you'll have help with the dishes.
Easy, boy. What is it?
What are you seeing?
Something out there?
-What are you doing here?
-Spying on you.
Boy, can he run!
I've got Father's best horse here and he can't even keep up.
Promise me you'll let him sire some stock for me.
Why are you spying on me?
Well, Father is a little worried about you.
He thinks you're getting a little too friendly with the Gentiles.
And what do you think?
-You need a wife.
-I'm getting tired of hearing that.
Let me tell you, there's nothing like a soft body to cuddle up with at night.
I don't want to hear about that.
-You like that Gentile girl?
-Why?
She sure is pretty.
You think she'll convert?
-Maybe I will.
-Now you're just being stupid.
You're the man.
She's the one who needs to convert.
Micah, do you love your wives?
I don't know.
I mean, what's love?
Maybe men don't fall in love, only women do.
-You ever thought about that?
-No.
You need a wife.
-Here you go.
-Where are you going?
Home, to bed, with my wives.
Well, be careful you don't go falling in love, okay?
It's okay.
At least I'm married.
Oh, you want me to put your horse away for you?
No, I'll do it.
I want to talk to father when he gets home.
Fine-looking horse.
Yes, he is, Father.
Where did he come from?
He was a gift to me.
Who would give you such a fine gift and why?
Well, the truth is, no one else could go near him.
So they gave him to me.
He'll make a great sire.
He'll definitely improve the quality of our stock.
-Yes.
-What's happening with the emigrants?
When do they plan to move out?
I think they plan to stay the two weeks that you gave them.
Have they said anything about the Prophet's murder?
I don't think they even know who Joseph Smith was.
Have you heard them talk about joining Buchanan's army, running us out of here?
All they want to do is go to California.
I think you've got them figured wrong.
They mean no harm.
Some of them are from Missouri.
Can't trust anyone from Missouri.
That's like saying every Mormon is perfect and can do no wrong.
You're not getting attached to the emigrants, are you?
What do you mean?
I notice those emigrant girls had an eye for you.
I've been thinking, the Taylor girl is awful pretty.
-It's time you took a wife.
-I don't want one right now.
Gwen Taylor is sweet on Donald.
I'm the Bishop around here.
You can have any girl you want as a wife.
I'm not interested in her, Father.
I don't want someone to marry me just because you're the Bishop.
Why not?
You have your mother's looks, my position.
Any girl would be proud to be sealed to you.
She was beautiful.
At least, that's how I remember her.
Is that how you remember her?
She was considered the most beautiful woman in these parts.
What happened to my mother?
After all these years, what does it matter?
It matters to me.
The Apostle took her away.
I want to know why.
He had a revelation that she was supposed to be his wife.
And you believed him?
She already had a family and a husband.
She was sealed to you in the Church.
As the Apostle Heber says, "Learn to do as you are told.
"lf you are told by your leaders to do a thing, do it.
"It's none of your business whether it be right or wrong."
It's wrong to take a mother from her children, a wife from her husband.
No one can do that.
There are many things that we don't understand, because we don't have direct revelations from God.
You didn't even argue with him, did you?
He was one of the Apostles.
